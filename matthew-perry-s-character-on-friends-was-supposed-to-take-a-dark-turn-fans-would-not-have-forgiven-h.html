Friends was the hottest show on television, while Chandler's relationship with Monica was loved by fans. However, there was a pitch made that could have completely changed the dynamic of their relationship and, in fact, a guest star claims she actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rehearsed the fateful scene that got axed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Cash was indeed supposed to appear during the episode that saw the cast of Friends in Vegas. She said of the episode, “I was told that [Perry] went to the writers and said the audience will never forgive him for cheating on Monica, which ― he was probably right.</p><p>That would have changed possibly the course of the show, and of his character.”</p><p>Credit to Perry for refusing the storyline. As for Lisa Cash, she still appeared in a lesser role on the show as a flight attendant.</p><p>Despite the nixed storyline, she praised her time alongside Matthew Perry.</p><p>“I was new to the industry, and it could have been really intimidating for me ― like, Season 5 of ‘Friends,’ and a scene with Matthew Perry!” she told TMZ. “But I just felt so comfortable, and he was really likable and welcoming and just made me feel at ease ... It was just really fun doing the scene with him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-19t165219-642.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:10</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fans-of-friends-believe-this-actor-played-a-different-character-on-the-show-before-landing-a-recurring-role.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The "Golden Rule" The Cast Of Friends Never Dared To Break Off-Camera, According To Matthew Perry</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The cast of Friends stayed true to a certain rule despite the temptation to break it.</span><p>The moment could have ruined things for lots of fans.

The actor would add his own humor to certain moments on the show, and was regarded as a comedic genius in that regard.</p><p>However, there were also moments when Perry stepped in. Speaking alongside Andy Cohen, Perry revealed the <a href=#>Friends storyline that caused him to step in and ban it</a> from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There was a storyline on Friends where Chandler went to a male strip joint because he really liked the sandwiches," the actor responded.

Krasinski admits throughout his lengthy stint on the comedy series, that it was the first time he said no to a storyline.</p><p>“That’s the only time I remember putting my foot down.

They are so dedicated. We have shown such great respect to them. But there’s a moment where if you push them too far, they’ll never come back. And I think that if you show Jim cheating, they’ll never come back.”</p><p>The actor went on to admit that causing this type of doubt was good for the show on the road to its finale.</p><p>“I feel like that kind of worry was good in terms of the fans’ engagement,” he said. “I needed to worry them that maybe I was going to give them a bad ending so they were happy when they got a good ending.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking back, Krasinski was completely right as such a scene would not have been accepted by many diehard Office fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2Beqauxo2Kwqa3RmpqtnaJivK95xaugnqaUqHq4rdJmqq6ooKTAprCMraZmrJGgsm6tjJ2Yq6NdqcKzuoyfmKerXay8trjDZqWorF2drrexjJ%2Bmq5%2BRq7JutMimZJ%2BnomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-hart-rapping-to-desiigner-s-panda-is-comical.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Hart Rapping To Desiigner's 'Panda' Is Comical</span></a>
