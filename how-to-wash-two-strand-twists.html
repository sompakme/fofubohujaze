I believe that <b>twisting</b> on <b>wet</b> hair will keep your coils moisturized much longer. <b>You</b> will not <b>have</b> to refresh your hair as much. <b>Twisting</b> on dry hair will give <b>you</b> longer/stretched <b>twists</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-wash-your-hair-with-twists></span>How do you wash your hair with twists?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-keep-two-strand-twist-from-frizzing></span>How do you keep two strand twist from frizzing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-should-you-keep-two-strand-twists-in></span>How long should you keep two strand twists in?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Two strand twists</b> can last a <b>long</b> time! Although this style can be time-consuming to create, they typically stay intact for <b>2</b>-6 weeks. Washing, conditioning and deep conditioning the style will <b>keep twists</b> looking fresh longer and <b>keep</b> hair healthy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-better-to-twist-hair-wet-or-dry></span>Is it better to twist hair wet or dry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To help you get that picture perfect style past day one, here’s what we suggest: Do your initial <b>twist</b> out on <b>wet hair</b>. Although doing a <b>twist</b> out on <b>dry hair</b> will give you more length, if you <b>twist</b> while your <b>hair</b> is <b>wet</b>, it will set <b>better</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-twist-your-hair-every-night></span>Should you twist your hair every night?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You’re</b> not retwisting <b>your hair</b> at <b>night</b>. “If <b>you</b> have shorter <b>hair</b>, it may be best to retwist <b>every night</b> to maintain <b>your</b> hairstyle. If <b>your hair</b> is longer, <b>you</b> can pineapple <b>your hair</b>.” For second or third day curls, Bova recommends Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Hold and Shine Moisture Mist to revive curls.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-twists-damage-your-hair></span>Do twists damage your hair?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A little known or less discussed fact is that <b>twists</b> are not for everyone; some actually experience breakage as a result of wearing <b>twists</b>. <b>Damage</b> can occur due to the <b>hair</b> being fine, weak and fragile. Some even slather gel on their <b>hair</b> strands prior to twisting.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-sleep-with-a-twist-out></span>How do you sleep with a twist out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-dry-a-twist-out-fast></span>How do you dry a twist out fast?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>How to Make Your <b>Twists Dry Faster</b></b><li class=TrT0Xe>Don’t make hair too wet. I know you may feel you must have hair wet for a proper style, but you are probably making hair too wet or using too much conditioner or gel.</li><li class=TrT0Xe><b>Dry</b> hair with a blow-dryer.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Don’t cover your <b>twists</b> at night.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Rock them <b>twisted</b>.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-can-i-wear-a-twist-out></span>How long can I wear a twist out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With a proper care, a <b>twist out can</b> last 1-2 weeks. Make sure to keep the ends moisturized and let the <b>twists</b> set for as <b>long</b> as possible (i.e., at least 3-5 days) before releasing them. When you sleep, <b>wear</b> a silk or satin bonnet to protect your hair.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-keep-twists-moisturized></span>How do you keep twists moisturized?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-sleep-with-two-strand-twists></span>How do you sleep with two strand twists?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-shower-with-twists></span>Can I shower with twists?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Washing Your <b>Twists</b> in the <b>Shower</b>. Wet your <b>twists</b> in the <b>shower</b>. Start by running some water lightly over your <b>twists</b> in the <b>shower</b>. For best results, use warm (not too hot) water.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-maintain-two-strand-twist></span>How do you maintain two strand twist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-two-strand-twists-help-hair-grow></span>Do two strand twists help hair grow?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Two</b>–<b>strand twists</b> are considered a protective style in the natural <b>hair</b> community as they can <b>help</b> minimize <b>hair</b> damage and therefore promote <b>hair growth</b>. The same <b>two</b> sections and <b>twisting</b> motion is applied, but after each <b>twist</b> of the sections, a little more <b>hair</b> is added to one of the sections before <b>twisting</b> again.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-better-twists-or-braids></span>Which is better twists or braids?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Since the style is more tightly packed, your strands will get more protection from <b>braids</b> than <b>twists</b>. For example, if you are a gym rat, <b>braids</b> are <b>better</b> since they will look <b>better</b> after an intense workout than <b>twists</b>. If you are looking for a style that requires less morning effort, choose <b>braids</b> over <b>twists</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6uK3SoWStr59iwLW%2BwKebZqynnsC1v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gallant-hints-at-surprise-music-during-billboard-power-event.html><span>←</span><span>Gallant Hints At &amp;quot;Surprise&amp;quot; Music During Billboard Power Event</span></a>
