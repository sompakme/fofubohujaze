I wanted to call and say, ‘Happy birthday.’ I know it’s a special day for you. I can’t wait to see you. I’m so proud of you,” he can be heard saying. “I love that you’re staying divine all the time, and you’re such an amazing woman. I can’t wait to see you later, and I’m so excited for our little bundle of joy, babe.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_dj-envy data-tag=dj-envy>DJ Envy</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_charlamagne-tha-god data-tag=charlamagne-tha-god>Charlamagne Tha God</a><a href=#> were caught off guard</a>.

An engagement ring.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chris then quickly rebutted, “Oh yeah, don’t worry,” to which Charlamagne responded, “Oh!
