Simpson's reputation changed forever in 1994. After he'd gotten divorced two years earlier, it was discovered that his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman lost their lives in a shockingly violent attack that year.In the years since that terrible event, the public has largely paid attention to what happened to O.J. If that wasn't incredible enough, it could easily be argued that people talk more about <a href=#>how O.J.'s trial affected the Kardashian family</a> than the people whose lives were ruined.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Robert Kardashian Really Believe OJ Simpson Was Innocent?</a></span>To their credit, Ron's family has voiced their grief and anger on several occasions and several of Nicole's relatives have as well. However, Nicole's children have avoided the spotlight. For that reason, most people have no idea that Nicole's daughter Sydney adopted a new name or if she switched back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-media-s-obsession-with-the-o-j-simpson-trial>The Media's Obsession With The O.J. Simpson Trial</h2><p>If you asked most people who were alive during the mid-'90s, they would have vivid memories of O.J. Simpson in court. Often labeled the trial of the century, the media spent weeks obsessing over every detail of O.J.'s trial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oj-simpson-trial.jpg><p>As a result of all the attention paid to that trial, a lot of people know where they were when O.J. was found not guilty. Furthermore, the media paid a lot of attention when O.J. was charged with a different crime, when he went to prison, and when he got out.</p><p>Even people who weren't alive during the '90s likely feel like they have a good idea of what happened as a result of <a href=#>shocking documentaries</a> and The People vs. O.J. Simpson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While millions of people have been fascinated by the events surrounding O.J.'s trial and what has taken place since then, it seems pretty clear that at least one person feels very differently. After all, according to reports, O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson's daughter Sydney has done everything she can to avoid the spotlight focused on the trial.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-o-j-simpson-and-nicole-brown-simpson-s-daughter>What Happened To O.J. Simpson And Nicole Brown Simpson's Daughter?</h2><p>No longer the child who was captured in photos alongside her parents before her mother's tragic passing, Sydney Simpson has become an adult.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is O.J Simpson's Daughter, Sydney Brooke?</a></span></p><p>According to reports, Sydney attended Boston University where she graduated with a BA in Sociology from the school's College of Arts and Sciences in May 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> BA in Sociology from the school's College of Arts and Sciences in May of 2010 Read more: <a href=#>https://www.legit.ng/1362747-sydney-brooke-simpson-bio-what-ojs-daughter.html</a> BA in Sociology from the school's College of Arts and Sciences in May of 2010 Read more: <a href=#>https://www.legit.ng/1362747-sydney-brooke-simpson-bio-what-ojs-daughter.html</a><p>Once Sydney launched her career, she reportedly founded a company with her brother Justin named Simpsy Properties, LLC. Since Sydney avoids the public, she hasn't confirmed that report. However, O.J. and Nicole's son and Sydney's brother Justin has confirmed he worked in real estate on Twitter by routinely posting about his job.</p><p>While at school, Sydney reportedly met a man named Stuart Lee <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who she dated for roughly five years</a>. Even though Sydney doesn't talk to the press, Stuart was interviewed by RadarOnline about his ex-girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Stuart, Sydney is a hard worker who talks about what happened to her mother in private and believed her father was innocent. Stuart also claimed that he tried to convince her to talk in public about what happened in hopes of helping other people deal with trauma and grief.</p><p>"She doesn't understand that her story could help someone else. When I was with her, I got friends in the industry I tried to set her up with and she said fame is a scary thing. It's so real to tell your side of the story."</p><p>"Everybody contacts her to speak out," he claims. "She could be an inspiration to so many people, but she's scared. She doesn't understand. Hopefully one day she will."</p><h2 id=what-s-the-truth-about-sydney-simpson-s-name>What's The Truth About Sydney Simpson's Name?</h2><p>In an ideal world, nobody would bug Sydney Simpson since she has made it clear she wants to have a life that is as normal as possible. Sadly, however, even though Sydney went to great lengths to evade the press, she wasn't always successful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>O.J Simpson Trolled After Claiming He's Scared To Bump Into Wife's 'Real Killer'</a></span></p><p>In 2014, Georgia Newsday revealed how Sydney's life had changed at that time. According to that report, Sydney was working at an Atlanta restaurant as a server without her co-workers or customers at that time knowing who she really was.</p><p>The reason Sydney was able to remain anonymous until that report was that her co-workers reportedly had been told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her name was Portia</a>.</p><p>While Georgia Newsday's report revealed that Sydney had adopted a different name, there wasn't any indication that she changed her name legally. Since then, there haven't been any other reports of Sydney going by anything other than her birth name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Sydney doesn't talk to the press, there is no way to know for sure what has gone on with her name. However, since recent reports about her life refer to O.J. and Nicole's daughter by her birth name, it certainly seems like her legal name is Sydney as of this writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqMalusSyZJuqn6S4pnnSoqSpq5%2Bjeq2xxpqjpbFdmLWiusaem2aglad6r63MnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susy-almeida-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-suzuki-salary-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Susy Almeida Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Suzuki, Salary, and Net Worth.</span></a>
