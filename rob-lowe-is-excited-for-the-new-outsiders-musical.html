I mean, it makes perfect sense. I hope it’s great. It should be great.”</p><p>“And stay gold!” Lowe added, referencing a line from the 1983 film and the 1967 novel of the same name.</p><p>Lowe, who played Sodapop Curtis in the movie, was 18 when filming began in 1982. He had appeared in a few TV roles, but The Outsiders marked his first time on the big screen. The film, directed by <strong>Francis Ford Coppola</strong>, also starred<strong> Matt Dillon</strong>,<strong> Ralph Macchio</strong>, <strong>Patrick Swayze</strong>, <strong>Emilio Estevez</strong> and <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>.</p><p>“We were all just learning, we were all so young,” Lowe told Us on Sunday. “I mean, it was my first movie. I thought all movies were shot like Francis Ford Coppola shoots a movie, and it turns out, nope.”</p><p>He added that the thing he remembers the most about the project is “the camaraderie” on set. “That, to me, was the equivalent of my fraternity,” he recalled.</p><p>The musical, which begins previews on Broadway on March 16, features a book by <strong>Adam Rapp</strong> with <strong>Justin Levine</strong> and music and lyrics by Jamestown Revival and Levine. Actor<strong> Jason Schmidt</strong> will make his Broadway debut as Lowe’s character, Sodapop.</p><p>The Outsiders also kicked off Lowe’s membership in the Brat Pack alongside Estevez, now 61, <strong>Demi Moore</strong>, <strong>Andrew McCarthy</strong>, <strong>Molly Ringwald</strong> and more. Throughout the 2024 awards season, Lowe was happy to cheer on fellow Brat Pack member <strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong>, who <a href=#>took home his first Oscar</a> on Sunday for his role in Oppenheimer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rob-Lowe-Is-Excited-for-the-New-Outsiders-Musical-2.jpg><p>“Gotta get my Santa Monica High School history class classmate Robert Downey Jr., got to have him get <a href=#>some long-overdue awards</a>,” Lowe told Us. “And that’s a big movie. It’s the kind of movie we should be making more of, ginormous in the zeitgeist. Everybody sees it. Everybody knows that, and it’s getting awards.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lowe added that he suspects Downey Jr., 58, and his fellow nominees are thrilled that they can finally take a break from red carpets now that the Oscars are over.</p><p>“It has become such a long award season,” Lowe explained. “They all crawl to the finish line. I think as much as everybody wants to win, a lot, I think they are all really looking forward to not putting on a tuxedo every fourth day.”</p><p>With reporting by Amanda Williams</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmoml2hvLixjKKqZp2omLa1scNmnaiqXam1pnnNnq5mp6WpwKqwxKuqZqWlqLakrcto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kicking-it-rich-the-highest-earning-footballers-in-the-saudi-professional-league-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>Kicking It Rich: The Highest Earning Footballers In The Saudi Professional League, Ranked</span></a>
