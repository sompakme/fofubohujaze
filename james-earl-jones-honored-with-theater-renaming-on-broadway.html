During his storied career, he has appeared in 21 Broadway productions including The Great White Hope&nbsp;(1969) and&nbsp;Fences (1987), which both garnered Tony Award wins for him. In 2017, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Tony Award.</p><p>Jones is one of the few talents in the EGOT community after having received a Grammy in 1977, two consecutive Primetime Emmys in 1990 and 1991, and an Honorary Lifetime Achievement Oscar in 2011.</p><p>“The Shubert Organization is so incredibly honored to put James—an icon in the theatre community, the Black community, and the American community—forever in Broadway’s lights,” Robert E. Wankel, Shubert CEO/board chair shared in a statement. “That James deserves to have his name immortalized on Broadway is without question.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurrHSZpyaqpxit7C6xKxkraCVlsGzsYybqaiZlKyuunmQa2ptbmVlgnZ8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-will-recent-controversies-impact-travis-scott-s-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Will Recent Controversies Impact Travis Scott's Net Worth?</span></a>
