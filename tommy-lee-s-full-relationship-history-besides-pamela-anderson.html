With Netflix's The Dirt, viewers got a look at Lee's life before he was known and during, but his relationship history wasn't fully showcased. His larger-than-life personality certainly has to do with his constant ups and downs in the love department. And since the movie didn't touch much on his romances, we thought we'd shed some light on the rock star's rollercoaster life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As Heather Locklear Celebrates Sobriety, It's Time For A Melrose Place Reunion!</a></span></p><p>Besides Pam, many women in Hollywood have one thing in common: they dated the fully tatted drummer of the infamous metal band. So, which women fell in love with this "bad boy" who led (and still leads) a wild life?</p><p>Here, we take a look at his relationships in more detail.</p><h2 id=elaine-starchuk><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Elaine Starchuk</span></h2><p>The California-native has a competitive roster of ex-lovers, but let us go way back!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biopic didn't touch on this at all, but in the mid '80s, Lee was actually married. Yes, the loud and wild drummer had settled down with Elaine Starchuk. His marriage to Starchuk, as you may or may not know, was the first of multiple marriages for the untamable star. The pair had dated a couple of years before they decided to tie the knot. However, they certainly weren't a match made in heaven as their marriage lasted a mere seven days.</p><h2 id=heather-locklear><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Heather Locklear</span></h2><p>So, the above marriage didn't work out even though Starchuk wasn't a Hollywood star! However, after that, the other women he was involved with, like the stunning Heather Locklear, were almost all in showbiz. Like Pam Anderson, the actress, who was then known for her TV roles, had a thing for rock and roll stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their whirlwind romance was highly profiled and even made it in the The Dirt biopic. The duo were a hot commodity and didn't waste any time before exchanging vows. In their early 20s still, the A-listers decided to make it official and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got hitched in 1986</a> after only a few months of being romantically involved. The groom in a white leather tuxedo and the bride in a flattering fishtail gown celebrated what they thought was eternal love among 500 guests. After eight years, their infamous love story came to an end!</p><h2 id=bobbie-brown><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bobbie Brown</span></h2><p>Bobbie Brown could quickly be mistaken for Lee's former love, Pamela Anderson. Brown is definitely Anderson's doppelgänger!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brown also had a thing for rock and roll men and rose to fame with her appearance in Warrant's music video for "Cherry Pie." What many don't know is that before Pam and Tommy's whirlwind romance, the drummer and music video stunner got engaged after six months of dating. In fact, the video vixen and the rock star were a hot commodity in the mid-90s - yes, they were the "in" couple. It wasn't long before it ended because Anderson swooped in and replaced her.</p><p>Well, years later, Brown decided to spill the details of their rollercoaster relationship (and love triangle) in her memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirty Rocker Boys</a>.</p><h2 id=sofia-toufa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sofia Toufa</span></h2><p>Who else fell under his spell? The Greek-German singer, Sofia Toufa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair started dating in 2009, but it was no merry-go-round! The two dated for four years before Lee, once again, decided to get down on one knee and pop the question. SOFI (her stage name) remained by his side, but they ultimately ended up parting ways in 2016. The musicians were engaged for three years, but Lee never took the next step for unknown reasons. Seems there were no hard feelings though.</p><h2 id=kimberly-stewart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kimberly Stewart</span></h2><p>The name sounds familiar because she's the legendary Rod Stewart's daughter! Of course, not even that could keep Tommy Lee away.</p><p>The model and reality star dated the drummer of "Home Sweet Home" back in 2007. Although it may have been just a fling since Lee didn't propose to the socialite, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their romance lasted roughly eight months</a> before the sparks diminished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tara-reid><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tara Reid</span></h2><p>There's also that time Lee linked up with the beloved American Pie star, Tara Reid. Lee definitely had a type at the height of his career: blonde, famous and flawless.</p><p>Thanks to a trip to Sin City, Lee met the Hollywood actress and it quickly became the start of something new for the two stars. Upon their return to Los Angeles, the famous faces decided to give it a shot by keeping things low-key and casual. Their romance was short-lived, but they indeed did have a great time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Facts Everyone Forgets About Tara Reid</a></span></p><h2 id=daisy-de-la-hoya><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Daisy De La Hoya</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Daisy de la Hoya gave reality television a shot, she had been involved with a few rock stars, one of them being Tommy Lee.</p><p>In 2008, it was reported that the Mötley Crüe drummer was dating Rock of Love 2's Daisy de la Hoya. The VH1 reality star seemed to be the drummer's soulmate with their very similar personalities, but it was another one of the iconic rock star's flings. Again, it was just another one of Lee's failed attempts at finding love!</p><h2 id=naomi-campbell><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Naomi Campbell</span></h2><p>Say what? What kind of magic potion does Lee use to make all of Hollywood's most coveted female stars fall for him?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The world-renowned British supermodel and rocker were an item back in 2004. Yes, Lee was able to snag a supermodel! The two were first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caught embracing while in Miami</a> because a mutual friend we all know, P.Diddy, introduced them to one another. Although their romance was brief, when they were together, they couldn't resist one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrities Congratulate Naomi Campbell As She Announces She's A Mommy</a></span></p><h2 id=mayte-garcia><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mayte Garcia</span></h2><p>No woman was off-limits for Lee, not even the iconic and famed musical innovator Prince's ex-wife. Mayte Garcia who was hitched to the "Purple Rain" singer got with the drummer almost immediately after her split from the musical genius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, the two were an item from 2001 - 2003. And not only did they date, but Lee, who was engaged more times than he's been married, had also asked Garcia to be his wife. They didn't make it that far in their relationship, as they ultimately decided to call the nuptials off.</p><h2 id=brittany-furlan><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Brittany Furlan</span></h2><p>Alas, Tommy Lee found the love of his life - Brittany Furlan!</p><p>Back in 2017, Lee met the popular internet star, and the rest is history. Although Lee and Furlan have a 24-year age difference, their love story is an adorable and modern one. Yes, Lee did the whole "follow and slide in the DMs" thing with his now-wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Valentine's Day, the cheesy rocker decided to pop the question - something he became a professional at - and Furlan said yes. Exactly one year later, the two met at the aisle and became a married couple. This makes it the rocker's fourth marriage, but he definitely found love with his silly and hilarious counterpart.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Pam & Tommy': 10 Facts About The Couple's Real Life Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKWdrnqtscSsZJ%2BtnKF6s7HLmquip56otaq8jKGgrKyfp8ZursSsoJ2do2K9ornEpZhmmZ6ZsrO%2Fzqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snapped-on-oxygen-who-is-falicia-blakely-and-what-did-she-do.html><span>←</span><span>Snapped on Oxygen: Who is Falicia Blakely and what did she do?</span></a>
