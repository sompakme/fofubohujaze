Some say that they're just in it for the PR, while others take joy in seeing people use their privilege to help others.</p><h2 id=jane-fonda><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Jane Fonda</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jane-fonda-grace-and-frankie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fonda's activist resume is as extensive as her filmography. In her youth, she was a controversial and outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. Despite the fact she was once married to one of the world's richest men, she advocates for the poor to this day. Fonda is also a staunch environmentalist, and she was one of many celebrities that got arrested during the wave of Extinction Rebellion and Sunrise Movement protests in 2019. Among those arrested were all of Fonda's Frankie and Gracie co-stars; Martin Sheen, Sam Waterson, and Lily Tomlin. Also, Joaquin Phoenix was there too.</p><h2 id=joan-baez><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Joan Baez</span></h2><p>Like Fonda, singer-songwriter Joan Baez was an outspoken activist in the 1960s. An advocate against war and for the working class, Baez was arrested in Oakland California in the 1970s for protesting the Vietnam War. She has performed music at several protests, including the 2003 protests against the <a href=#>Iraq War and the Occupy Wallstreet protests</a> of 2010-2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rosario-dawson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Rosario Dawson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rosario-Dawson-and-Cory-Booker.jpg><p>Dawson was arrested during something called the "Democracy Spring" protests in D.C. The protest was a public stance against dark money and corporate lobby influence in politics. Dawson also endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election but supported her then-boyfriend Cory Booker in the 2020 primary. Dawson continues to advocate for a multitude of causes ranging from anti-racism to electoral reform.</p><h2 id=james-cromwell><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>James Cromwell</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cromwell was arrested in 2019 along with several other animal rights protesters. Cromwell and the others glued themselves to a counter in a Starbucks to protest the use of <a href=#>dogs for scientific experimentation</a> at nearby Texas A&M University.</p><h2 id=porsha-williams><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Porsha Williams</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/porsha-williams-rhoa.jpg><p>The reality tv star <a href=#>was picked up by Atlanta police in July 2020</a>. Williams was taking part in a Black Lives Matter protest about the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman shot by police in her bed in Kentucky. Her death was the result of a botched "no knock" search warrant. Williams is now a prominent advocate for police accountability and anti-racism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aoc><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>AOC</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AOC-Flaunts-Her-MET-Gala-Dress.jpg><p>Okay, it might be a bit of a reach calling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a "star" but let's face it, she is a rising political star with legions of fans. The democratic socialist and congressperson from New York were arrested along with many of her colleagues protesting the Supreme Court's overturn of Roe V. Wade, which has drastically damaged a woman's right to abortion throughout the country. Although she did not get arrested for it, AOC also joined environmental protestors outside of her colleague Nancy Pelosi's office when she was first elected.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bernie Sanders Was In An Indie Rom-Com: 10 Times Politicians Tried To Act</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-schumer><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amy Schumer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Amy-Schumer-pic.png><p>Although Schumer has many detractors for her alleged joke thefts, she also has many bad-faith political detractors. Schumer is a self-proclaimed feminist, and an advocate for survivors of sexual assault. When Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh was first nominated, women came forward with allegations of sexual assault. Despite evidence and demands for further investigation, Kavanaugh was still appointed to the court. Schumer took to the streets and was arrested for protesting his appointment in October 2018.</p><h2 id=emily-ratajkowski><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Emily Ratajkowski</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emily-Ratajkowski-Via-Instagram.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ratajkowski was also arrested for protesting Bret Kavanaugh's appointment. The model was not silent about her arrest either, "Today I was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Men who hurt women can no longer be placed in positions of power. Kavanaugh's confirmation as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is a message to women in this country that they do not matter. I demand a government that acknowledges, respects and supports women as much as it does men."</p><h2 id=shailene-woodley><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Shailene Woodley</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Woodley was arrested in 2016 along with several others at an encampment protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline on the Standing Rock Reservation. The protests were led mostly by members of the Sioux nation and other indigenous tribes. Woodley live-streamed her arrest, using her celebrity status to draw more attention to the fight against the pipeline. Woodley claims she was brutally strip searched during her detainment.</p><h2 id=susan-sarandon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Susan Sarandon</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Susan-Sarandon.png><p>Sarandon is not shy about her leftist politics or her distrust in the two-party system. Also, years before the BLM movement exploded, Sarandon was arrested for protesting at NYPD headquarters in 1999. Sarandon and 2018 others were taken into custody while protesting the police for killing an unarmed African immigrant named Amadou Diallo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cynthia-nixon><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cynthia Nixon</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FDD285D3-6965-423B-9A4D-7EFD1E4DC145.png><p>The Sex and The City star has been becoming increasingly political over the years. After endorsing Bernie Sanders and coming out as Democratic Socialist, she tried a few <a href=#>unsuccessful attempts at running for public office</a>. But her activism goes back farther than some might think. She was arrested in 2002 outside of New York City hall demanding more money for public schools. Nixon continues to advocate for unions, black lives, immigrant rights, cannabis legalization and more. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist organization in the United States.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cynthia Nixon Declares Miranda's Queerness Shouldn't Have Been A Surprise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-o><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Steve-O</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Steve-O.jpg><p>It should not surprise anyone that when Steve-O got arrested, he made sure to add a touch of Jackass to the motif. The stuntman was arrested in 2015 after scouring a crane at a Hollywood construction site to protest SeaWorld for animal cruelty. He flew a large inflated killer whale from the top of the 100 ft tall crane. Also, he set off some fireworks, because of course Steve-O did.</p><h2 id=woody-harrelson><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Woody Harrelson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The TV and film star was arrested in 1997 <a href=#>at an anti-logging protest on the Golden Gate Bridge</a>. Similar to Steve-O, he climbed the famous bridge illegally to protest the clearing of a 60,000-acre grove of old redwoods. Harrelson said of his arrest, "I spend a lot of my time in Los Angeles, where you can't breathe the air or swim in the water. We're fighting that. We're fighting for a sustainable industry that does not destroy the environment." Harrelson is also a long time advocate for cannabis legalization.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHq4tM5mnqisXZa%2Fs7HSrZydZZGperG%2Bzq2crKyjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-matty-finochio-from-the-wedding-veil-trilogy-actor-slowly-becoming-a-heartthrob-of-the-natio.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Matty Finochio From The Wedding Veil?
