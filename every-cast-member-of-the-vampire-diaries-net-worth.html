Well, not in the literal sense of the word, but there was a time, not that long ago, when you couldn't change the channel without being hit by some sort of movie or television series that was somehow related to vampires. Truth be told, Twilight fever opened a lot of doors for production companies to make some serious bank.</p><p>One of the byproducts of this was, of course,&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries.&nbsp;Based on a series of books that had been around long before Edward and Bella came into our lives, the show was so popular amongst the young-adult audiences that it lasted for eight entire seasons. Even though it met its end in 2017,&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries&nbsp;was a landmark many fans still remember fondly. And with that being said, let's take a look at how much it helped the cast with their own personal wealth.</p><h2 id=michael-malarkey---1-million>Michael Malarkey - $1 Million</h2><p>Michael Malarkey's role as seductive vampire Enzo was a turning point in the actor's career. Even though the British-American star had his first role in 2001, he wouldn't be cast again until eight years later, in 2009, in the TV movie&nbsp;The Selection.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Outlander's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Malarkey kept on acting in a series of small roles, mostly in documentaries, short films, and made for television movies. Once he was cast as Enzo, the roles kept coming, and he has since been featured in projects that include&nbsp;Raw, Impirioso, The Oath, and, most recently,&nbsp;Project Blue Book.&nbsp;He was also featured in a Zara Larsson music video - everything comes together for a nifty $1 Million net worth!</p><h2 id=matthew-davis---2-million>Matthew Davis - $2 Million</h2><p>Professor Alaric Saltzman was such a popular character throughout the run of the original&nbsp;Vampire Diaries,&nbsp;Matthew Davis was lucky enough to be brought back into the series spin-offs,&nbsp;The Originals&nbsp;and&nbsp;Legacies.&nbsp;However, it wasn't Alaric that put Davis on the map. Long before Alaric appeared on screen, Matthew was already building his career.</p><p>He began acting almost twenty years ago, in 2000, and ever since then, he kept a steady flow of appearances on movies and television shows going for him. And hard work does pay off! Matthew Davis currently has an estimated net worth of $2 Million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-r-mcqueen---3-million>Steven R. McQueen - $3 Million</h2><p>Elena's little brother Jeremy went through quite a bit during his time on the show. However, what can one expect from a television series like&nbsp;Vampire Diaries,&nbsp;where death and drama seem to be the most common themes? Either way, the now 31-year-old actor was no stranger to the world of acting prior to his casting as Jeremy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Sopranos Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Beginning in 2005, McQueen was featured on a series of popular television shows, including&nbsp;<i>Chicago Fire,&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;Everywood.&nbsp;He also has a movie coming out in 2020, which surely will add some extra numbers to his already impressive $3 Million net worth.</p><h2 id=kat-graham---3-million>Kat Graham - $3 Million</h2><p>Stunning actress Kat Graham dabbled in acting for the first time in the fan-favorite movie&nbsp;The Parent Trap,&nbsp;starring Lindsay Lohan as the lovable twins in 1998. That was not the last time Graham would be featured in a Disney project - she actually appeared in a couple of episodes of&nbsp;Hannah Montana&nbsp;way back in the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both during and after her run on&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries,&nbsp;Kat participated in a number of other projects, including&nbsp;17 Again&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Roommate.&nbsp;She voices April on&nbsp;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,&nbsp;and has two more movies coming out in the near future. No secret to how she managed to get to $3 Million!</p><h2 id=candice-king---4-million>Candice King - $4 Million</h2><p>King's interpretation of Caroline Forbes was nothing short of fantastic, and fans everywhere were thrilled to witness the character develop so beautifully throughout the course of the show. Candice King's charisma came as no surprise, considering she's been spreading it on the screen since 2007.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Men On The Bachelor, Ranked</a></span></p><p>She kept playing the character of Caroline Forbes on the spin-off&nbsp;The Originals, plus, she's currently filming her new movie&nbsp;After We Collided,&nbsp;the sequel to fan-fiction based movie&nbsp;After.&nbsp;Right now Candice's net worth sits at an impressive $4 Million, but there's no question this number will continue to increase.</p><h2 id=zach-roerig---4-million>Zach Roerig - $4 Million</h2><p>Ohio native Zach Roerig made his way into the acting world over a decade ago. In 2004, he was featured on an episode of&nbsp;Law & Order, and after the fact, he continued to make appearances on smaller movies and television series, including&nbsp;One Life To Live&nbsp;and&nbsp;As The World Turns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being cast as Matt in&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries,&nbsp;he reprised his role on the series spin-off&nbsp;Legacies,&nbsp;like his former castmate Matthew Davis. He recently finished filming a new movie and is set to star on the upcoming television show&nbsp;Dare Me.&nbsp;Props for the hard work, the $4 Million net worth is more than well-deserved!</p><h2 id=michael-trevino---4-million>Michael Trevino - $4 Million</h2><p>Everybody's favorite werewolf Tyler Lockwood was a break-through role for Michael Trevino, instantly teleporting him to fame. However, that's far from being the first role the actor ever played. He currently has 27 acting credits to his name, the first one dating back to 2005 in&nbsp;Summerland.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest Paid Talk Show Hosts In America</a></span></p><p>He was featured in a number of episodes of well-known series, including&nbsp;<i>Prison Break, Without A Trace,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;Cold Case.&nbsp;He starred in two movies after departing the show, and he's currently playing the part of Kyle Valenti in the show&nbsp;Roswell, New Mexico.&nbsp;All in all, Trevino's net worth clocks in at $4 Million.</p><h2 id=paul-wesley---6-million>Paul Wesley - $6 Million</h2><p>Arguably the sweetest half of the Salvatore brother duo was Stefan. He went through his fair share of ups and downs throughout the run of the show, but he couldn't have been loved the way he was by fans if it wasn't for the fantastic portrayal given by Paul Weasley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Audiences were already familiarized with Wesley's face - he's been popping on and off in several projects, mostly television series. Currently, he stars in the television show&nbsp;Tell Me A Story&nbsp;and has harnessed quite the fame as a model. His reputation and hard work following the show have granted Paul Wesley the amazing net worth of $6 Million.</p><h2 id=ian-somerhalder---8-million>Ian Somerhalder - $8 Million</h2><p>Bad boy Damon Salvatore broke the hearts of numerous fans around the world when he announced his split from co-star Nina Dobrev, and later when he married fellow actress Nikki Reed. He couldn't stay single forever! Somerhalder had already built quite the resumé with a role in television shows like&nbsp;Lost&nbsp;and&nbsp;Smallville.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of Parks and Recreation</a></span></p><p>Much like his on-screen brother, Somerhalder also scored a handful of gigs as a model. Most recently, he finished filming a new movie and stars in the show&nbsp;V-Wars.&nbsp;Thanks to all of his on-going and past projects, Ian now has a net worth of $8 Million.</p><h2 id=nina-dobrev---10-million>Nina Dobrev - $10 Million</h2><p>Not a single fan of the show was able to keep composure when Nina Dobrev announced she was going to depart the show. After being shot into stardom, Dobrev decided to pursue different movie roles instead of being stuck playing Elena forever. That decision paid off in the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since leaving the show, Nina scored a number of projects, most of them on the big screen. These include&nbsp;Flatliners, Crash Pad, Departures,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Run This Town.&nbsp;She now stars on the television show&nbsp;Fam&nbsp;and has two more movies coming out. Nina Dobrev has turned into a full-blown movie star, and it shows - she has a net worth of $10 Million. Impressive!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#>&nbsp;Every Cast Member Of Vikings' Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTDornPoqmeZZSerrO1xKxknq6Vp8Zur8Csq2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-watson-flashes-tramp-stamp-tattoo-in-short-shorts-high-heels-bra.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Watson Flashes &amp;quot;Tramp Stamp&amp;quot; Tattoo in Short-Shorts, High Heels, Bra</span></a>
