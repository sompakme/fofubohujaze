That all changed in December 2022, when <a href=#>M3GAN</a> premiered in Los Angeles. That change would end up becoming confirmed following its theatrical release earlier this month. Debuting at number 2 and making over $150 million at the box office, M3GAN was met with positive reviews, and film writers are now talking about a sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A reviewer from Variety wrote that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film is a diverting genre film and "possesses a healthy sense of its own absurdity."</a> Critics and movie watchers in this day and age look for horror films that hold a certain "it" factor. The more unique, the better it will be. This film was more difficult to work with due to it being similar to several other classic films. However, it's proven to viewers that it does have the "it" factor, and it would come as no surprise if the sequel were to be just as popular as this one. With these facts in mind, here is why 'M3GAN' will go down as a horror film classic for years to come.</p><h2 id=m3gan-humor-is-dark-in-the-most-modern-way><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>M3GAN Humor Is Dark In The Most Modern Way</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Any movie made in 2022 is expecting to fit modern times in order to be more believable. The same goes for horror films. Thankfully, M3GAN did just that, especially during the scene involving a bully of the protagonist.</p><p>While his fate was not the best, the lines during the scenes between the two of them contained the simplest, yet strong lines that can add a tiny bit of humor to an unfortunate part of the film. However, it wasn't just this scene that brought the modern vibe this film needed. Another scene brought it over the top, which will be discussed below.</p><h2 id=the-inspiration-of-m3gan-is-both-clever-and-inventive><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Inspiration Of M3GAN Is Both Clever And Inventive</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/m3gan-dolls.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evil or not, M3GAN could only be created by someone who is a technological genius. That factor alone makes this doll different from the rest, especially since it did not come alive from the supernatural. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Producers James Wan and Jason Blum explained why</a> this was the case to Screen Rant. "We felt that it was important to make a movie that was grounded, that felt real, like it could happen anytime soon in the world that we’re living in,” said Wan. "It feels very relevant to the world that we're living in today."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>M3GAN Became 'Much More Interesting' For Allison Williams When She Became A Mom</a></span></p><h2 id=m3gan-39-s-female-leads-are-no-strangers-to-acclaimed-horror-projects><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>M3GAN's Female Leads Are No Strangers To Acclaimed Horror Projects</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/allison-and-violet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actresses Allison Williams and Violet McGraw play the creator and friend of M3GAN, both of which received positive reviews for their acting in the film. It's not surprising considering the pair have experience in this genre.</p><p>Williams plays the female lead in the Academy Award-winning film Get Out, in which she too was praised for her performance. McGraw starred in the supernatural horror miniseries The Haunting of Hill House, which also received positive reviews from critics. The two of them have also starred in multiple other horror projects, most of which also received critical acclaim.</p><h2 id=the-demise-of-characters-in-m3gan><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Demise Of Characters In M3GAN</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's never a surprise when you hear one is predicting that all main characters of a horror film will die. However, what wasn't predicted was the "lovely" dance M3GAN did in the hallway before going for another kill. It was because of that dance that people stopped talking about the kills, and more about that dance, and what the purpose was behind it.</p><p>What makes that little addition unique is that one wouldn't see that in any other horror films. The dance before the kill made the movie, and people are still talking about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of M3GAN Has Said About The Horror Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=the-girls-who-portray-m3gan-did-not-hold-back><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Girls Who Portray M3GAN Did Not Hold Back</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/amie-donald.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>M3GAN was portrayed by actresses <a href=#>Amie Donald</a> and Jenna Davis. While Donald did the physical parts, Davis played her voice. The girls put their heart and soul into portraying this vengeful doll, and with little acting experience did they do so. In a way, the dance was extra special for Donald since she herself is a dancer. In fact, the dance was choreographed by her longtime teacher while filming took place in New Zealand.</p><p>Although Donald was a knockout in her performance, Davis's voice work is also something worth noticing. Any teenager who can take an innocent voice and turn it into something outrageously freaky will have a future in the entertainment industry, whether in person or voice work.</p><h2 id=the-doors-are-open-for-unforgettable-crossovers-with-m3gan><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Doors Are Open For Unforgettable Crossovers With M3GAN</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-Happened-Between-Chucky-and-M3GAN_.jpg><p>Crossovers are one of the biggest things that can make a movie and television show more interesting. However, it can especially do so for this due to the amount of horror film dolls one can choose from. For example, the three Annabelle films were incredibly popular among movie goers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While critics were harsh on some of the films, the title character left a legacy in horror, one that M3GAN seems to be doing as well. However, it could also be interesting to see M3GAN partner with Chucky, who is one of the first horror film dolls in existence. Either way, the possibilities are endless, and since M3GAN already has a future, it's interesting to see what and who will be in it.</p><h2 id=the-addition-of-comedic-actors-in-m3gan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Addition Of Comedic Actors In M3GAN</span></h2><p>For those who recognize M3GAN's victim in the hallway, that is because you've seen him in the film Crazy Rich Asians. Comedian Ronny Chieng has been stepping out of his comedic comfort zone over the last few years, with M3GAN being his first horror film. Although his fate is unfortunate, it would make sense for him to go after M3GAN's memorable hallway dance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian Jordan Alvarez also stepped out of his comfort zone, and luckily, his character did not face the same untimely fate. Although Alvarez has not confirmed he will return for the sequel, due to the conclusion of the first film, it's more than likely he'll make an appearance.</p><p><span class=article-alert>SPOILER ALERT! The next entry speaks of M3GAN's ending.</span></p><h2 id=m3gan-39-s-ending-is-both-creepy-and-satisfying><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>M3GAN's Ending Is Both Creepy And Satisfying</span></h2><p>After defeating M3GAN, the two female leads have seemingly started over on the relationship they must now have. The aftermath shows that help is now there, and the supporting characters have survived the ordeal. However, as there is always a catch, a camera turns on by itself and looks towards the scene. It can mean a variety of things. It could be M3GAN, it could be another robot, it could even mean absolutely nothing. Audiences will likely find out what it means in the sequel, which will include both Williams and McGraw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of this publication, M3GAN 2.0 will be released in theaters in 2025. Writer Akela Cooper will return. Neither Donald nor Davis confirmed that they will return, but it is likely they will return as M3GAN. No other cast announcements have been made, and there is currently no word on when filming will begin. M3GAN fans can look out for a trailer sometime at end 2023-2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdooCorc1mrqKknGK0sHnDqK6nZZGoeqJ5x6ipq6eiYrOquMxmmqWZo6i2pHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-s-returning-for-season-14-of-real-housewives-of-new-york-city.html><span>←</span><span>Who's Returning For Season 14 Of 'Real Housewives Of New York City'</span></a>
