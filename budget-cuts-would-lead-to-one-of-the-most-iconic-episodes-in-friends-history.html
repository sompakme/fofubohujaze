Behind the scenes, things weren't the greatest for Matt LeBlanc, who sustained a very real shoulder injury. However, in front of the camera, fans adored the episode and it became one of the true favorites of the series.</p><p>As we'll reveal, the simplicity of the episode all took place because of a small budget. This turned out to be a major plus, as fans still can't get enough of the episode.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-dislocated-his-shoulder-in-the-episode-the-one-where-no-one-s-ready>Matt LeBlanc Dislocated His Shoulder In The Episode, The One Where No One's Ready</h2><p>It was a memorable episode for fans but when it comes to Matt LeBlanc, it was a moment he'll likely want to forget. As it turns out, he dislocated his shoulder during this very episode. The moment can be spotted by fans, as it takes place when Joey is battling it out for a spot on the couch with Chandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>LeBlanc recalls the painful experience</a>, which lots of fans didn't even notice.</p><p>"We both look at each other, look at the chair, and neither one of us is sitting in it. So we both race to the chair, and I have to just step over the coffee table and land on this big, huge comfortable chair."</p><p>LeBlanc continues, "I don't even think it qualifies as a stunt. Somehow I ended up completely upside down, and I was going to land on my head between the table and the chair, so I put my arm up to break my fall and just exploded my shoulder."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Warner Bros Threatened To Fire Two Of The Main Cast Members On Friends During Renegotiations</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The injury was written into the show, with Joey apparently jumping and falling off the bed...</p><p>Although the episode was forgettable for the actor, it became an iconic one for the fans.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-no-one-s-ready-became-an-iconic-episode-despite-the-fact-that-the-show-had-a-limited-budget-for-it>The One Where No One's Ready Became An Iconic Episode, Despite The Fact That The Show Had A Limited Budget For It</h2><p>The episode aired back on September 26th in 1996. Episode 2 from season 3 is remembered as a fan favorite, given that it just features the main cast, with a lack of outsiders. Fans also adored the episode due to the fact that it was the first to be shot in real-time, with non-stop action taking place.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>A 27-Second Ovation From The Studio Audience On Friends Changed Everything For Chandler And Monica's Romance Storyline</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The simplicity of the episode is what truly made it all so great. However, according to Insider, there was a reason for it. In the episode, <a href=#>the show had a limited budget</a>. Therefore, exploring and shooting scenes elsewhere wasn't an option, and neither was bringing in other actors.</p><p>Insider writes, "On the television special "Friends: Final Thoughts," the producers revealed that the episode was restricted to Monica's apartment due to budget cuts. They couldn't afford multiple filming locations."</p><p>Friends fans were not disappointed, as episodes shot specifically in Monica and Rachel's apartment turned out to iconic, including a few Thanksgiving episodes.</p><h2 id=aside-from-the-main-cast-there-were-only-three-speaking-roles-in-the-entire-episode>Aside From The Main Cast, There Were Only Three Speaking Roles In The Entire Episode</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the main six, roles were limited during the episode, aside from speaking roles. According to IMDb, <a href=#>there were only three other roles during this episode</a>, which were speaking roles.</p><p>IMDb writes in its trivia section of the episode, "Other than the main cast, there are only three speaking roles in this episode: Peter Dennis, who appears as Dr. Sherman Whitfield in the credits scene, and Tom Selleck and an uncredited actress who voice Richard and Michelle Burke on Monica's answering machine."</p><p>Putting the cherry on top of a classic episode, it was the 50th in the show's history. They would enjoy many more from that point on, lasting ten successful seasons.</p><p>Looking back at all the episodes, the simplest shoots are always considered among the most popular from its hardcore fanbase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dpLumedahnKudXaO8o7vDsqpmqpWWsbp5zqdkn6qZmrulv4yep6Krn5mybrDErZiipKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-perkins-net-worth-how-much-is-bill-perkins-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Bill Perkins Net Worth How Much Is Bill Perkins Worth?</span></a>
