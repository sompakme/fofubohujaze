So when they walk into the room, that’s what people are thinking about, they’re not seeing them for who they are. And I think that has to be a really hard thing for them.<a href=#> I’d love to protect them from that</a>.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The “Let’s Get Loud” singer explained that while “bullying” can be hard no matter “who you are,” it’s difficult for her two kids, Emme and Max — whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> — to “grow up and be themselves” when they feel “judged by people” they “don’t know.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“They know there is a lens on them,” she continued, noting that while their particular struggle might not be “relatable,” it remains a challenge for her teenagers — and is something the Marry Me star carries with her.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I did that to them. So we have this guilt as moms about what we do and what we’ve brought into their lives,” she shared.

That’s what I want to instill in them so I don’t have to protect them from anything, they can protect themselves.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While the Grammy nominee wants nothing but the best for her kids, she revealed earlier this month that <a href=#>the twins are really “giving it to her” as a parent</a> now that they’re getting older.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“They’re becoming adults. They are challenging everything in life,” she explained during the May 3 episode of the<a href=#> Today </a>show. “These kids have so much information, so much more than we had. They’re thinking and talking about things and about life in a different way than I did when I was 15 or 16 years old.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Hustlers star, however, said she isn’t worried about her children having curiosities. “I think they’re gonna change the world,” she said. “And make it so much better, so much better than what we did.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Lopez tied the knot with Anthony, 54, in June 2004 and welcomed Emme and Max four years later.
