After an interview in which the duchess opened up about intimate elements of her family life and difficulties finding work during her early days as an actress, Meghan hit the streets on a guided mission from Ellen with real-life street vendors - which brought about some very cringey interactions!</p><p>It seems that the pair have plenty of history together, however. So how close are these two really? Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-and-ellen-degeneres-bonded-together-at-a-dog-shelter><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Meghan Markle And Ellen Degeneres Bonded Together At A Dog Shelter</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, Meghan and Ellen bumped into each other at a dog shelter in Los Angeles several years ago while the Suits actress was deliberating over whether to take a dog home. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen spoke to Meghan, telling her "You have to take that dog."</a> Bogart the labrador, as he became known, became Meghan's dog that day after Ellen's enthusiastic encouragement.</p><p>"Although Meghan didn't grow up with pets, Bogs, as she called him, became the object of her devotion and in heavy rotation on her Instagram feed," the book Finding Freedom states. "But she credits Ellen DeGeneres as the reason she adopted the Lab mix."</p><p>"How could she refuse," the book adds. '"It's sort of like when Oprah tells you to do something," Meghan said. "I brought him home. Because Ellen told me to."'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meghan-markle-and-ellen-degeneres-then-hit-it-off-and-kept-up-contact><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Meghan Markle And Ellen Degeneres Then Hit It Off And Kept Up Contact</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It seems that the pair never looked back following this interaction, and struck up a real friendship, meeting up in London from time to time and sharing advice regularly.</a></p><p>"Meghan adores Ellen and loves the fact that she and Portia are huge animal lovers," an insider said. "She said they have stayed in touch since meeting in person and have become close."</p><p>"She said they actually have a lot in common and that Ellen has been a huge support, especially since moving to Canada."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why 'Brothers and Wives' Might Sour Prince Harry And Meghan Markle's Relationship With The Royal Family Once More</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-was-one-of-the-few-people-to-meet-megan-39-s-son-archie-after-he-was-born><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ellen Was One Of The Few People To Meet Megan's Son Archie After He Was Born</span></h2><p>The Sussexes are famously private about their family, but Ellen was reportedly one of the privileged few to meet their first child, son Archie, while Ellen was staying in the UK. The talk show host was even allowed to hold the child, and has spoken about the experience, joking: “He weighs 15 lbs., which is, the exchange rate, is 17 dollars here!”, and also mentioned that he shares dad Harry's famous hair colour.</p><p>Since then, Ellen has reportedly bonded with the couple over environmental issues and joint charitable interests.</p><h2 id=now-they-live-nearby-ellen-frequently-comes-over-to-megan-markle-39-s-house><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Now They Live Nearby, Ellen Frequently Comes Over To Megan Markle's House</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ellen and Meghan now both live in a similar area in California, and as such frequently see each other. Ellen is reportedly a frequent guest at Meghan and Harry's Montecito mansion, frequently 'popping over' to see the couple, and has apparently also met their children, Archie and Lillibet.</p><p>It seems that proximity is making the heart grow fonder for these two, who both enjoy time in the California sun. Ellen's Burbank studio was just a short drive for Meghan to appear on Ellen's show. Its not clear just how often these two see each other, however, outside of professional appearances.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-39-s-friend-omid-scobie-claims-she-and-ellen-are-close><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Meghan Markle's Friend Omid Scobie Claims She And Ellen Are Close</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen's friend and casual spokesman Omid Scobie has claimed that Ellen and Meghan are good friends.</a></p><p>“Ellen and Meghan go back longer than we think,” Scobie said. “Meghan actually first met her when she was deciding whether to rescue a dog. Ellen famously told her, ‘Get it.’</p><p>“Since then, they’ve developed a close friendship. We saw Portia and Ellen visit London. They visited Harry and Meghan at their home. … They got to meet Archie for the first time, and they’ve also collaborated on some of their charitable work, too. Harry and Meghan supported Ellen in an elephant conservation initiative that she was involved in, and I think we’ll see them come together with their work as well as their social life much more in the future.”</p><h2 id=it-seems-that-meghan-markle-and-ellen-degeneres-are-definitely-friends-but-its-hard-to-say-how-close><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>It Seems That Meghan Markle And Ellen Degeneres Are Definitely Friends, But Its Hard To Say How Close</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meghan and Ellen certainly appear to be familiar with each other - having met outside of the show on multiple occasions, but we have little proof that they spend much time together. It is therefore hard to say for certain that they are close friends, but they are clearly a little more than just acquaintances.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Meghan Markle And Prince Harry Bail On The Queen's First Christmas As A Widow</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdXZnCpLTErKpmp5ZiwLa%2F0p6vZp2cobKvecOenp6mlaeytHnFq6CeppSoerG%2ByKeanmWYlr%2BzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fynn-kliemann-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Fynn Kliemann Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
