Envy got on the airwaves this morning (Sept. 12) to address the Baby Boy actor’s <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234762879>Instagram Live</a> from the night before.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Envy claims he had Tyrese blocked after the latter asked him and his wife to go on Live to “s**t on” Samantha. The DJ claims to have responded by saying, “I’m passing on this. I prayed on it, it wasn’t in the cards. Bless; have an amazing day.” He later suggests that Tyrese tried to “plant a seed” by stating, “If you had a man like me, it wouldn’t go down like that.” Envy never publicized that until now because he feels Tyrese really did save his marriage. While admitting that he appreciates how the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234648878>Beautiful Pain</a> singer helped, he also has tried to hurt the couple — and apparently has done the same thing with another unnamed couple.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Live, Tyrese said he “lost sleep” over Envy alleging he “disrespected” him and Gia. “Anyone who knows me knows I’ve been around some of the most beautiful people. It’s not in my character to disrespect anyone,” he explained.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234784528>The singer </a>feels Envy is “milking” the fact that he was on <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234741211>psych meds</a> and for Tyrese, he stated, “You’re not describing me. You’re not describing me as a man.” The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234761879>Fast & Furious</a> star reportedly pulled up his own receipts that “prove” the three of them were in communication as of August 2023, which seemingly discredits the dates where Envy supposedly had him blocked.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tyrese continued to say that he isn’t making anything up, but doesn’t remember anything he allegedly said or did. “I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. Do I believe I disrespected y’all?” he shakes his head no and adds that Envy just wanted to go viral. “The only way I can go to sleep at night is if I clear my name.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m3brHNr7Bmn5mWeqSt0p6wZqypp7K0sYyfqaKdnpnAqbXPZqypnJGpsm59kWxrcHBpaoZ2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jackson-hinkle-wiki-career-girlfriend-parents-age-net-worth-education-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jackson Hinkle?
