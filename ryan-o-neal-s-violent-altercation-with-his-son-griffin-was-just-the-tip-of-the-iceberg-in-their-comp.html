After an extremely complicated life yet fairly <strong>successful acting and boxing career</strong>, O'Neal's time on this earth was cut short by a <strong>lengthy battle with cancer</strong>. News of his passing was broken on Instagram by his son, Patrick O'Neal. In the post, Patrick praised his father, calling him his hero. This sentiment was not shared by Patrick's siblings and half-siblings, least of all Griffin.</p><p>Griffin O'Neal, like his sister Tatum, was the product of Ryan's marriage to actor Joanna Moore. While Tatum's relationship with her scandal-embattled father was nowhere near perfect, Griffin's was positively toxic. This included at least two extremely violent altercations that represented the tip of the iceberg in terms of just how bad things were between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-o-39-neal-and-his-son-griffin-39-s-terrible-relationship-involved-violent-altercations>Ryan O'Neal And His Son Griffin's Terrible Relationship Involved Violent Altercations</h2><p>Pain, addiction, and heartache have plagued <strong>all four of Ryan O'Neal's children</strong>. This includes his youngest, <a href=#>Redmond O'Neal who suffers from addiction issues</a>. The same is true for his older half-brother Griffin. According to People, Griffin had been surrounded by drugs and alcohol from a young age. He even claimed he was the family's "joint roller". Not only was his father an addict, but his mother, Joanna Moore, was also dependent on substances. This followed an extremely turbulent childhood of her own and a complicated relationship with both her then-husband and her career in Hollywood.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Ryan O'Neal's Children (according to People)</p></td><td><p>Who Is Their Mother?</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tatum O'Neal</p></td><td><p>Joanna Moore</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Griffin O'Neal</p></td><td><p>Joanna Moore</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Patrick O'Neal</p></td><td><p>Leigh Taylor-Young</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Redmond O'Neal</p></td><td><p>Farrah Fawcett</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My life has been a reign of drug and alcohol degradation," Griffin O'Neal said in 2015 during an interview with People.</p><p>"I had to self-medicate my entire life because there was pain everywhere. There were drugs everywhere in my family all day, every day. It was the ’60s and ’70s and Tatum and I had a tough time."</p><p>According to People, Griffin became ensnared by substance addiction at the extremely young age of 9. By the time he graduated from high school, Griffin had already done two stints in rehab. Griffin's access to drugs and alcohol at a young age is one of the reasons why many believe <a href=#>Ryan was a bad father</a>. In multiple interviews, Ryan himself claimed he wasn't "great" at being a dad aside from the fact that he was "hands-on".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-12t142221-324.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened To Farrah Fawcett's Son Redmond O'Neal, And What's His Net Worth?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Farrah Fawcett left her son millions of dollars, so how much is Redmond O'Neal worth today—and where is he?</span><p>There are conflicting reports as to when the first of at least two violent incidents occurred between Ryan O'Neal and his son, Griffin. People claimed it was in 1983 when Griffin was 16 years old. While other sources state that it was 1982, and Griffin was 18. But given that Griffin was born in 1964, he would have been closer to the age of 18 when his father allegedly punched his teeth out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ryan-o-neal-s-violent-altercation-with-his-son-griffin-was-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-in-their-complicated.jpg><p>According to UPI, Griffin decided not to pursue formal assault charges after his father allegedly knocked out two of his teeth during a fight. Griffin claimed that he and his father got into an argument about playing racquetball, of all things. While little else has been revealed about this alleged event, a lot more was revealed about their extremely violent fight in 2007. This event fractured their relationship forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=was-ryan-o-39-neal-arrested-for-assaulting-his-son-griffin>Was Ryan O'Neal Arrested For Assaulting His Son, Griffin?</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan O'Neal was arrested in 2007</a> after he allegedly shot a gun at his son, Griffin.

No reputable information about this supposed reconciliation exists.

"And he showed very little remorse for trying to shoot me in the face."</p><p>"The last time I saw my dad, he shot at me because I was trying to help his son [Redmond] get sober."</p><p>Despite supposedly having a relationship with her son Redmond, Griffin was banned from Farrah Fawcett's funeral. In his interview with Larry King, Griffin stated that he was always very close to Fawcett, who he saw as a step-mom. This was just an ounce of the drama that surrounded the Charlie's Angels star's passing. <a href=#>Ryan O'Neal even blamed his daughter Tatum for Fawcett getting sick</a> in the first place. This was during the same interview with Piers Morgan where he stated that Griffin was not to be trusted because he "sells stories".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/farrah-fawcett-s-will-caused-controvery-after-she-left-money-to-her-ex-but-nothing-for-her-actual-partner-at-the-time-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tatum-o-neal.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tatum O'Neal Won On Oscar At The Age Of 10, But Is She Still Acting?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tatum O'Neal is an Oscar Award winner.
