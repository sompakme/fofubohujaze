Is my spray tan coming off?” she said, listing examples of what she thinks about. “So much.”</p><p>In addition to her NSFW comments, Teigen also gushed about her sweet relationship with Legend, whom she married in 2013. “He’s as good and pure as you could imagine a man to be. He really is that good,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>shared</a>. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, is he so nice?’ I’m like, ‘Yes, he’s nice. He’s sweet. He’s kind. But, he’s, like, brilliant.’ … His levels of empathy for other people, and he’s just like a, I don’t know, a sponge of kindness and goodness.”</p><p>After all that gushing, Teigen couldn’t resist poking fun at the Grammy winner, 45, and his fashion choices. “Ever since he started <a href=#>The Voice</a>, really, his style really became poppier and much more in your face,” Teigen joked. “And yeah, I find myself going out with him sometimes, I’m like, ‘We know you’re John Legend already. You don’t have to wear this much print on print on print on print.’”</p><p>Teigen met Legend on the set of his 2006 music video for “Stereo,” and the pair got engaged five years later. The couple went on to welcome four kids: Luna, 7, Miles, 5, Esti, 12 months, and Wren, 7 months. Teigen suffered a <a href=#>pregnancy loss</a> in September 2020 and later revealed she and Legend had <a href=#>named their late son</a> Jack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chrissy-Teigen-Admits-That-Her-Mind-Wanders-During-Sex-With-John-Legend-1.jpg><p>Having been together for more than a decade, Teigen and Legend have figured out how to maintain a healthy romance. “Keeping their relationship hot is a priority,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> earlier this month, adding that the duo frequently “schedule date nights” and enjoy dining out.</p><p>“Chrissy feels so lucky to have a husband who is as romantic as he is attractive,” the insider added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple also bond over their shared love of Bravo. “Everything that I know about Bravo, he knows about Bravo too,” Teigen shared on the Monday, January 29, <a href=# rel=noopener>episode</a> of Watch What Happens Live!. “He’ll play football, but he’ll still pay attention to Bravo. I mean, that’s a match [made] in heaven.”</p><p>Despite their fan status, Teigen revealed that Legend had an awkward response when she recently invited <a href=#>Summer House</a>’s <strong>Carl Radke</strong> to <a href=#>share a ride</a> on their private jet. “[Carl] was like, ‘Hey, man, I just want to say thank you so much. I love you.’ It was so sweet, and John was like, for a minute I could see John being a little … ,” Teigen revealed during an interview on SiriusXM’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Andy Cohen Live</a> on Thursday, January 25.</p><p>When asked by host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> whether Legend was jealous of Radke, 39, Teigen said she thought so. “He’s got the tight pants, and he looks great,” she quipped. “[John’s] like, ‘Yeah. [Carl’s] sober and he’s just, like, a really wonderful personality like you said. He just seems like a fun, cool dude.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLTFjK2cop%2BVo3qisMyiq6xlpJ2utXnHnqlmpZmjsW7DwKebnqqjYrG2vsinnmarla16uLXToWSjp5ijeq2xxp6lnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexandra-king-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Alexandra King Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
