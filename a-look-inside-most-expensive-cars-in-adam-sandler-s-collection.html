He is usually categorized with other members of the <a href=#>Bad Boys of SNL (Saturday Night Live)</a>, consisting of the brutally honest Chris Rock, David Spade, Will Ferrell, Rob Schneider, and Chris Kattan. In addition to starring alongside some of <a href=#>Hollywood's greatest on-screen talents like Jack Nicholson</a>, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston, David Hasselhoff, Christopher Walken, and Kate Beckinsdale, Sandler also own a production company, Happy Gilmore, which has been responsible for the production of many of his movies. With his $480 million net worth, here are the most expensive cars in Adam Sandler's garage.</p><h2 id=ferrari-488-pista---350-000>Ferrari 488 Pista - $350,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One may wonder what a funny guy like Adam Sandler would be doing behind such a seriously powerful supercar like the Ferrari 488 Pista. Despite being designed primarily for speed, the Italian two-door Italian sports machine has a spacious cabin space with broad fenders and a gracefully arched roof. While the Ferrari car brand is recognized as a symbol of prestige and power and is owned by <a href=#>celebrities such as Kevin Hart,</a> skateboarder Rob Dyrdek, and Kim Kardashian, its twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V-8 engine isn't for the faint of heart. It can go from zero to 60 mph in just 2.7 seconds and generates an intimidating 711 horsepower, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Car and Driver</a>. The Ferrari 488 Pista may have cost Sandler between $331,000 and $350,000, making it his most expensive known car purchase.</p><h2 id=lincoln-navigator---107-000>Lincoln Navigator - $107,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Used by government agencies for armored car protection</a>, Lincoln Navigator is, for obvious reasons, an intimidating mass of metal on wheels. But it's not big and useless as some might imagine. On the other hand, the luxurious SUV features Adaptive Suspension with Road Preview, which means that, with the help of a front camera, it can spot upcoming bumps in the road and prepare the suspension to lessen the impact on the vehicle and make your ride smoother. The four-wheel-drive powerhouse generates 440 horsepower from its twin-turbocharged engine and is regulated by a 10-speed automatic transmission. Its massive size, comfort, and speed spell safety for many drivers, which is why celebrities like the <a href=#>football legend David Beckham</a> and Hollywood actors Will Smith and Sandra Bullock are among those who own one.</p><h2 id=cadillac-escalade---90-000>Cadillac Escalade - $90,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cadillac might as well have an endorsement deal with Adam Sandler being that he owns so many different models of the car brand. Cadillac Escalade has been heavily promoted as a luxury SUV in many rap videos and is owned by <a href=#>renowned names such as Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez</a>, and the famous pop/R&B singer, Justin Bieber. The Escalade has a starting price of $76,000 and can reach up to $90,000. Its hefty size can accommodate the seating capacity of 7/8 people and is powered by a 6.2-liter V8 engine in the standard version, making it the largest SUV compared to other brands like Land Rover, Porsche Cayenne, Tesla Model X, and Mercedes-Bez G-Class, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Drive-My.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>From Flipping Burgers To A $60 Million Net Worth: The Chris Rock Story</a></span></p><h2 id=dodge-challenger-srt-demon---87-000>Dodge Challenger SRT Demon - $87,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This next car in Sandler's collection proves that not only does he have a knack for satirical jokes, <a href=#>but also a need for speed</a>. By the sound of its name alone, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon would inspire fear in any driver, and it should, especially with a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine that pushes 808 horsepower. Perfectly designed for drag racing, the SRT Demon can jump from zero to 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds It also comes with an active exhaust system, adaptive suspension, and a spacious interior compared to other speed demons, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Car Buzz</a>.&nbsp;The Waterboy actor may have paid roughly $87,000 for a grad monster that would seem a better fit for <a href=#>Vin Diesel in The Fast and The Furious!</a></p><h2 id=lexus-ls-4th-generation---73-000>Lexus LS 4th Generation - $73,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another popular luxury vehicle in Sandler's garage is the fourth-generation Lexus LS 460 and it's no surprise that it is the most expensive standard Lexus produced in the company's entire history. The sporty and classy vehicle is powered by a 4.8-liter V8 engine, producing more power and more torque than previous models. The car also includes an eight-speed automatic transition with a very luxurious inside designed to provide comfort and a level of hospitality to the passengers. And Sandler isn't the only one who appreciates the luxurious experience of the Lexus brand. <a href=#>Other Hollywood A-listers</a> like Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Reese Witherspoon, and lots of others also have one of these gems stashed away in their garage.</p><h2 id=cadillac-dts---65-000><span class=next-single>Cadillac DTS - $65,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One Cadillac just isn't enough when your net worth is over $450 million. Perhaps he treats his Cadillacs as he does his real estate portfolio and likes to keep his options open! The Cadillac DTS is stylish enough to look like a Lexus with the backseat space and trunk cargo capacity of a Sedan. Listed as one of Sandler's older car purchases, the DTS is powered by a 4.6-liter V8 and generates 282 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque activated by a four-speed auto gearbox, according to 21 Motoring. Another fun fact is that in 2005 Cadillac built a DTS Presidential State Car which was used by <a href=#>former President George W. Bush</a> during his second term. Cadillac also ceased production of the DTS in 2011 and replaced it with the 2013 Cadillac XTS.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>6 Extravagant Ways Adam Sandler Spent His $420 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car Buzz</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drive-My</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaamZx6pa3DnbBmn5GnrqixjJpkpaefoHqqutKim55lnaTAtXnEsaeepqOew6Z5wpqprGWZo3qisMCmZKyZnpm5pr7SZpqopJyasLW1zqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-things-wwe-s-bad-girl-paige-wants-you-to-forget.html><span>←</span><span>15 Things WWE's Bad Girl Paige Wants You To Forget</span></a>
