She then went on to amaze fans by falling in love with former football star Kroy Biermann... on screen!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim and Kroy's relationship resulted in a spinoff show, as well as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a whole lot of public interest in their PDA.</a> While much of their life was on blast for the world to tune in to, there are some very interesting things fans that have been discovered about this interesting couple.</p><h2 id=divorce-isn-t-in-their-vocabulary><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Divorce Isn't In Their Vocabulary</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marriage seems to be the kiss of death for many Hollywood relationships</a>, so Kim Zolciak-Biermann decided to take matters into her own hands to protect her relationship with Kroy Biermann. When the two were engaged, they discussed the fact that "divorce" was not a word that would enter into their vocabulary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They pursue their lives on the basis that divorce is never an option, and that they will always work together to find a solution to whatever ails or threatens their relationship. Nicki Swift reveals Kim as saying; "I would never allow a show to impact my marriage in any way. My marriage is definitely first."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Kim Zolciak Speak To Any Of Her Former ‘RHOA’ Castmates?</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-publicly-shames-kroy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kim Publicly Shames Kroy</span></h2><p>Kim and Kroy are not shy about putting their personal life out there in the public sphere, and it appears that Kim is also quite comfortable dragging their dirty laundry into the spotlight, too. She has publicly shamed Kroy by making comments about the age difference between them, revealing her own insecurities in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She blasted an Instagram message in which she "jokingly" said;"Boy did I rob the cradle with you and I'm so glad I did! You amaze me daily somehow, someway .... everyday although it's annoying that you know everything literally."</p><h2 id=kroy-adopted-kim-s-daughters><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kroy Adopted Kim's Daughters</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim had two children from her previous relationship, </a>and Kroy really stepped up to the plate and officially adopted them both. He has openly discussed that marrying into an instant family has taught him a lot about balance and has taught him to prioritize, and it's evident that her daughters are top priority for Kroy. He has made a lot of sacrifices and has opened up about the fact that he had led a "regimented" life before sharing his home with Kim and her daughters, but that this was a welcome adjustment, as he truly adores them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Real Housewives Of Atlanta': 10 Things You Should Know About Porsha Williams</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-really-digs-kroy-s-derriere><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kim Really Digs Kroy's Derriere</span></h2><p>Everyone finds a particular aspect of their spouse incredibly attractive, and for Kim, the one thing she is&nbsp;especially vocal about is her love for Kroy's derriere. Kim is incredibly attracted to Kroy's backside, and isn't afraid to ogle over it at every opportunity. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star went on-air to say; "Wow he's got a really cute butt and a million-dollar smile. I love big wide smiles," and later clarified that this wasn't scripted for television - it's her real-life obsession.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-took-time-for-kroy-to-adjust-to-the-media-attention><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Took Time For Kroy To Adjust To The Media Attention</span></h2><p>There's no mistaking the fact that Kim absolutely loves the spotlight. She's not at all shy about having cameras around and seems flattered when she's sought after by the paparazzi. However the transition into this level of spotlight was really not what Kroy had signed up for.</p><p>He admits to the press that this was overwhelming for him at first, and that it took him quite a bit of time to get used to. He's a much more private person when it comes to his relationships and the media attention was something he had to work hard to accept.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Nene Leakes' $2.1 Million "Hotel-Like" Atlanta Home</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-almost-broke-up-on-their-8th-anniversary><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Almost Broke Up On Their 8th Anniversary</span></h2><p>It has recently been revealed that the public interest in their relationship, the constant cameras and paparazzi, and the endless media coverage were far too much for Kroy to handle. This frenzy of attention affected him so much that he almost called it quits on their relationship at the eight-year mark.</p><p>Thankfully, Kim and Kroy were able to work through this issue, likely due to the fact that they had already committed to sticking things through and solving all problems.</p><h2 id=they-get-frisky-when-it-s-risky><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Get Frisky When It's Risky</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim and Kroy are very open, candid, and forthcoming about their "extra curricular activities" and have spoken about their intimate lives very openly and freely in front of the cameras. It's been discovered that they aren't shy about getting frisky when things are risky and are known to indulge in their selfish pleasures with their children in close proximity. They&nbsp; have also admitted to "doing it" in public and especially seem to enjoy playing around outside of their home, in plain view of their neighbors.</p><h2 id=kroy-cut-off-his-parents-for-kim><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kroy Cut Off His Parents For Kim</span></h2><p>Many fans may not be aware that Kroy cut off his parents for Kim. They were completely unimpressed by the fact that she has two children from previous relationships, and they red-flagged her as being the wrong type of person for their son. The tension was too much for Kroy to bear, and at one point, he had to make a decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He chose Kim over his own parents, and the family has remained estranged for years.</p><h2 id=they-spent-nearly-1-million-on-their-wedding><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Spent Nearly $1 Million On Their Wedding</span></h2><p>Kim and Kroy's wedding was so lavish and elaborately planned that it took nearly one million dollars to execute. That hefty price tag went towards three stunning dresses worn by Kim as well as an 11 layer cake that she just "had to have."</p><p>They spared no expense making this the wedding of their dreams, stating that they only do this once and therefore, wanted it to truly be everything they had ever wanted.</p><h2 id=their-tax-problems-nearly-got-them-evicted><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Their Tax Problems&nbsp;Nearly Got Them Evicted</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2014 was the year that Kim and Kroy's finances were dragged into the public sphere. It was revealed that they had taken out a $300,000 loan to renovate their mansion in Georgia and were at risk for eviction due to back-owed taxes. They had well over $1.6 million in outstanding debt and had 90 days to repay that total before their home was seized.
