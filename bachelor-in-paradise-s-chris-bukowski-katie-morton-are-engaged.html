While Chris made it clear that he was only there for Katie, she second-guessed their romance and told him to pursue other people during the August 20 episode. After Chris went on a date with <a href=#><strong>Jen Saviano</strong></a>, however, the medical sales representative realized she made a mistake.</p><p>Fans first met Chris during season 8 of The Bachelorette, which aired in 2012. He was 25 years old at the time and <a href=#><strong>Emily Maynard</strong></a> eliminated him after hometown dates. After appearing on Bachelor Pad season 3, Chris attempted to crash season 10 of The Bachelorette, but lead <a href=#><strong>Andi Dorfman</strong> </a>opted not to let him join the show. He later attempted to find love on seasons 1 and 2 of Bachelor in Paradise before announcing his “retirement.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He confirmed in July that he was back for one more shot at love. “Coming back for my pension in paradise. #bip,” Chris wrote alongside his cast photo via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Katie, meanwhile, was a contestant on <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a>’s season of The Bachelor earlier this year. She was sent home during week 6 of season 23.</p><p>The Bachelor in Paradise season 6 reunion airs on ABC Tuesday, September 17, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BjKKlZqiRp66ltdKeqmabmKe2tHnBrqKor6Ogtm63wK2gnmWdpL%2B1u81mmKudXZq7qK3Gnpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-and-hip-hop-star-maurice-mo-fayne-gets-17-years-for-ppp-fraud.html><span>←</span><span>'Love and Hip Hop' Star Maurice &amp;quot;Mo&amp;quot; Fayne Gets 17 Years For PPP Fraud</span></a>
