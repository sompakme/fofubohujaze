We want to know as much as we can about each cast member and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their wealthy, glamorous lives</a>: what they used to look like, what they do, who they’re married to, what they’re like. The housewives entertain with their onscreen shenanigans throughout each season, but sometimes their life before the show can be just as interesting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 'Real Housewives' Who Have Been Arrested</a></p><p>The history that has shaped them into becoming the person they are today. Many of the housewives come from diverse backgrounds and&nbsp;some are not originally from the city of their show or even from the United States itself. Whilst most of the housewives are US citizens, some were born outside of the US, from the UK and Europe to Asia and the Middle East, and had a really interesting start to life. Let’s find out more.</p><h2 id=lisa-vanderpump><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lisa Vanderpump</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Where else to start but with the lady herself- LVP. Arguably the most famous Brit on reality tv, Lisa’s unmistakable cut-glass English accent is instantly recognizable anywhere. This English rose was born in London, but has also lived in the English countryside, the South of France, and, of course, the USA and now calls Beverly Hills home. However, Lisa is not a US citizen, so the first lady of reality tv can never become President! Lisa is enjoying entertaining guests at home on her new show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Overserved.</a></p><h2 id=adriana-de-moura><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Adriana De Moura</span></h2><p>This well-educated, well-connected OG of the Real Housewives of Miami was born in Brazil and can speak an impressive five languages, namely English, French, Spanish, Italian, and her native Portuguese. She studied&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Art & Culture in Florence</a> and at Paris' Sorbonne Institute. Adriana lived in Texas with her first husband, before later settling in Miami with her second husband Frederiq Marc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kary-brittingham><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kary Brittingham</span></h2><p>Kary was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and is the first to say she has a pretty strong accent. The Real Housewives Of Dallas cast member is a successful businesswoman and has made Dallas her home. Although proud of her Mexican heritage, she took exception to former&nbsp;castmate LeeAnne Locken's comments describing her as, amongst other things, "a chirpy Mexican." This lead to LeeAnne leaving the show but since then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kary herself has been accused of being a bully herself by fans.</a></p><h2 id=peggy-sulahian><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Peggy Sulahian</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peggy was born in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuwait</a> to Armenian parents and relocated to the US at the age of one. She is married to husband Diko and they have three children,&nbsp; Giovanna, Gianelle, and Koko. Peggy lives in Newport Beach and has American citizenship. Although she was only on one season of The Real Housewives Of Orange County, Peggy sparked a lot of interest and at one point was the most searched housewife. She was also the 100th housewife to enter the franchise.</p><h2 id=carlton-gebbia><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Carlton Gebbia</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Brit, Carlton was an interesting addition to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. </a>Born in London, Carlton grew up there and in South Africa before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue acting. Like her castmate, LVP, Carlton has a classy British accent which belies a naughty sense of humor and a saucy side to her character. Carlton is a practicing Wiccan and has three children, Mysteri, Destiny, and Cross. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Since splitting from her husband</a>, she has been spending a lot of time in Miami.</p><h2 id=joanna-krupa><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Joanna Krupa</span></h2><p>Beautiful Joanna was born in Warsaw, Poland, and moved with her family to Chicago at the age of five. Joanna made a name for herself as a model before finding fame on The Real Housewives of Miami. Her sister Marta is also a model and appeared on the show. Joanna&nbsp;has appeared on the cover of several magazines, including in South Africa and her native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Poland where she now resides</a>, and where she married husband Douglas Nunes, father to their young daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiffany-moon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tiffany Moon</span></h2><p>Doctor Tiffany was born in China, in a small town just outside of Beijing. She moved to the US at six years old and didn't speak a word of English. Tiffany went on to become a wife, mother, and board-certified anesthesiologist, something that has no doubt pleased her, as she calls them, 'tiger parents.' Tiffany has also had work published and is an avid supporter of animal rights as well as featuring on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives Of Dallas.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things You Didn't Know About RHOD Newbie Tiffany Moon</a></span></p><h2 id=yolanda-hadid><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Yolanda Hadid</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside, LVP, Yolanda brought a touch of class to the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.&nbsp;Born in raised in the Netherlands, Yolanda was discovered as a model and after moving to the US, went on to have three model children with ex-husband Mohamed Hadid, Gigi, Bella, and Anwar. Yolanda has battled Lyme disease since being diagnosed in 2012. She was granted US citizenship in 2013.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of Yolanda Hadid Proving She Looks As Great As Gigi And Bella</a></span></p><h2 id=joyce-giraud><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Joyce Giraud</span></h2><p>Joyce was born in Puerto Rico and began modeling aged 16. Demonstrating both beauty and brains, she completed two Bachelor of Arts degrees by the age of 19.&nbsp; A few years later, aged 23, Joyce was crowned Miss Universe Puerto Rico 1998 and the same year she came second representing Puerto Rico at Miss Universe.&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She appeared on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills in 2013.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=catherine-cat-ommanney><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Catherine 'Cat' Ommanney</span></h2><p>Last but not least, another Brit, Cat Ommanney, who appeared on The Real Housewives Of D.C.&nbsp;Cat's tagline: "I'm here for a good time not a long time" would prove fairly prescient as the show was canceled after one season.&nbsp; However, with her gravelly upper-class accent and cheeky sense of humor, Cat made a lasting impression and came out with some pretty amusing one-liners.&nbsp; Cat is now based on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish island of Mallorca</a> and appears to be loving life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Talked About 'Real Housewives You've Probably Never Heard Of</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWimq6teceorKydp57Dpr%2BMsJ%2BoZaeav6a602aZqKqeYravedOhnGatXah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yes-oscar-isaac-is-also-obsessed-with-drag-race.html><span>←</span><span>Yes, Oscar Isaac Is Also Obsessed With Drag Race</span></a>
