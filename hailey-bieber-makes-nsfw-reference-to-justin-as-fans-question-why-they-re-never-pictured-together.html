This is not how it works."</p><p>While Hailey’s post may have seemed inconspicuous, some fans believe the sign was an indirect message for followers who’re demanding to see photos of Hailey and Justin together, since fans are noticing it’s been a while since the couple posted anything together online.</p><h2 id=why-fans-think-hailey-and-justin-are-living-separately>Why Fans Think Hailey And Justin Are Living Separately</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hailey-bieber-and-justin-bieber-at-new-york-heliport.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hailey and Justin have made a few public appearances together in recent weeks despite the divorce rumors, including at Coachella. The couple shared a lovey-dovey moment in the crowd while enjoying music. Fellow concertgoers captured the moment, which went viral on social media.</p><p>However, one of Hailey’s music festival outfits seemed to further the relationship problem rumors. The model was <a href=#>pictured backstage at Coachella in an oversized outfit</a>, which is uncharacteristic of her style. While some people accused her of simply wanting to copy Justin’s infamously unkempt look, others said she may have been wearing something baggy in hopes of starting pregnancy speculation to deflect from the divorce accusations.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:23</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-17.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Justin Bieber Was Accused Of Copying A Song That's Over 40 Years Old</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Justin Bieber faced copyright infringement accusations for a song he released in 2019.</span><p>"Now her fans going to say 'aww she’s wearing Justin’s baggy clothes, to cover her bump,'" one person wrote on a Reddit thread discussing Hailey’s Coachella look, while another said, "Clearly not pregnant- her stomach looks totally flat!?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There continue to be rumors suggesting the couple are living separately, which was only fuelled when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin purchased a $16 million mansion</a> earlier this month. The singer was also spotted leaving a hotel, leading some fans to question if he’s been staying there instead of his home with Hailey.</p><p>It also didn’t help last month when Stephen Baldwin, Hailey’s father, made an Instagram post asking fans to pray for the couple without any context. This prompted Hailey to go online shortly after to encourage her followers not to believe the rumors about her marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Just FYI the stories and constant ‘blind items’ I see on TikTok are 100% of the time wrong.
