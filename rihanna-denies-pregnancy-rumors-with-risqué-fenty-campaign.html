This includes last month, after Riri was seen by paparazzi in an oversized coat despite the warm weather, leading some to question if she was hiding a baby bump.</p><p>The 36-year-old singer stepped out in NYC in a light grey tank top that featured a lacy bra peeking through, paired with sleek black pants. However, it was Rihanna's choice of outerwear that truly caught the eye of many. Despite the warm weather, she donned a heavy winter coat and strategically held a Louis Vuitton purse in front of her midsection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her striking combination of summer attire and winter wear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">prompted a wave of speculation on social media</a>, particularly on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rihanna-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Rihanna Confirms She’s Releasing New Music After First Public Performance In Years Flops">Rihanna Confirms She’s Releasing New Music After First Public Performance In Years Flops</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It may be too little too late for Rihanna's career, as fans were thoroughly unimpressed with her latest performance.</p><p>One user on X asked, “Rihanna pregnant again. Why she got on that coat in 80 degree weather in New York???” expressing confusion over her seemingly mismatched outfit. Another fan humorously commented, “Ntm on Rihanna [laugh emoji] pregnancy can cause hair thinning/loss smh it happened to my mom. And she been pregnant for YEARS.”</p><p>A third Twitter user observed, “I just knew Rihanna was pregnant again the way she kept covering her belly,” suggesting that her choice of clothing might be a subtle hint at news of a new pregnancy.</p><p>Rihanna hasn’t directly addressed the speculation over baby no. 3. She already has two boys with her partner ASAP Rocky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiecOepaKdo2K9s7HGp5inm6liv7a5zquqZp6Vo8G6ecKapKmZmZy7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-westbrook-salary-contract-nationality-number-name-change-40-time-high-school-draft-coll.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Westbrook Salary, Contract, Nationality, Number, Name Change, 40 Time, High School, Draft, Coll</span></a>
