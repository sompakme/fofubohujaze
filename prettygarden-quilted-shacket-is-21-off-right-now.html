Sweater weather is great, but when you realize it coincides with shacket season? There’s a reason fall fashion is always the leader of the pack. As we layer up, our outfits just get better and better (and better).

The small diamond quilting all over doesn’t only add a cute visual element, but it makes the piece feel plush and extra cozy as well. We also like the longer, curved hem and dropped shoulder seams to add to the comfy, oversized vibes!</p><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Prettygarden collared shacket</a> has a button-up front with functional flap pockets at the chest. It comes in nine colors too, including fall must-haves like wine red, army green and dark khaki!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/amazon-prettygarden-quilted-shacket-khaki.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Prettygarden Quilted Button-Up Shirt Jacket</a> (originally $48) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$38</a> at Amazon!
