The 1992 film, which was directed by Robert Zemeckis <a href=#>(the man responsible for Forrest Gump</a>) featured two Beverly Hills rivals desperate for eternal youth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It starred Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn and offered a ton of pointed but thought-out commentaries on the media, Hollywood, plastic surgery, and the standards of beauty. It also featured acclaimed model and actor Isabelle Rossellini in an absolutely movie-stealing role.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an excellent interview with Vulture</a>, Isabella shed some light on her memorable character and her experience getting cast.</p><h2 id=how-isabella-rossellini-was-cast-in-death-becomes-her>How Isabella Rossellini Was Cast In Death Becomes Her</h2><p>1992 was an important year for Isabella Rossellini. Not only did Death Becomes Her come out, but she was also <a href=#>heavily featured in Madonna's highly controversial "S*x" book</a>, for which she later had some criticism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One was so linked to my life as a model because the Madonna book was done by Steven Meisel, who’s a great fashion photographer with whom I worked a lot," Isabella explained to Vulture.</p><p>"For me, Madonna and Steven Meisel were my life as a model, and Death Becomes Her was cinema."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Madonna Causes A Commotion On The Cover Of Paper Magazine</a></span></p><p>Isabella admitted that she very much wanted to be part of Robert Zemeckis' Death Becomes her.</p><p>"I wanted that role very much. Robert Zemeckis, who’s such a lovely director and wonderful person, told me I was one of the first people to test, so he needed to test more people because the studio wanted that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But given the subject matter of the film and the character, Isabella knew she was the right choice.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Meryl Streep Is Certainly One Of The Best Actresses Alive, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>"I kept on saying, 'But I work for Lancôme! I sell anti-aging cream! I’m the perfect one!' He called me a month later and said, 'You know what? The role is yours.' I was so delighted."</p><h2 id=what-isabella-rossellini-really-thinks-of-death-becomes-her>What Isabella Rossellini Really Thinks Of Death Becomes Her</h2><p>While the movie made a ton of money at the box office, it wasn't exactly loved by critics. Over time, it gained cult status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We thought it was going to be like Roger Rabbit, a film for families. But it has a cult following, and mostly a following from the <a href=#>gay community</a>. That was surprising to us. We appreciate it, but it wasn’t the aim," Isabella admitted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Once Hated Cult-Classics Actually Ended Up Making A Ton Of Money</a></span></p><p>While Isabella loved the movie, she was thrilled with her character. Mostly because she thought it was "ironic" and "funny".</p><h2 id=isabella-rossellini-39-s-character-in-death-becomes-her>Isabella Rossellini's Character In Death Becomes Her</h2><p>During her interview with Vulture, Isaballea explained that she felt that her performance, which touched on the risque side, came directly from her experiences in the fashion industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think it came from me. Being a model and selling beauty, you exaggerate that. Working with Lancôme, I represented another voice of fashion. But there is a voice in the fashion world of absolute beauty, absolute perfection, not inclusiveness but exclusive to the max. That was the inspiration," Isabella admitted.</p><p>"In a way, Lisle is a caricature of the fashion victim. That was the model I had in mind. All my movements were very studied — the way I stand up, sit down; everything was poised. I thought that fit the character of this crazy lady who does everything for beauty."</p><p>Of course, Isabella also credited the costumes for how she found the character.</p><p>"The costumes were so much fun. Some of them were even better in life than what resulted in the film," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the costumes and Isabella's history as a model weren't enough for her to fully inhabit her character. In fact, she claimed to have used a body double for her NSFW scenes. This is because she thought the character needed to look like a Barbie doll, and she had a more curvy physique.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger Nearly Had A Very Different Castmate In His Cult-Hit Jingle All The Way</a></span></p><p>"It needed to be someone who looked like [Brigitte Nielsen]. I don’t have the perfect body — I’m rounder, my legs are not as long. We got a body double, and I love that she comes out of the pool still wearing high heels. She swims with high-heel shoes. Then when the scene continues and I talk to Bruce Willis, I have a coat."</p><p>While Isabella's body was covered by a coat for the rest of that specific scene, she did wear a stone outfit that barely covered her top. So, not everything was done by a body double.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless, Isabella is proud of her contribution to the film and is thrilled that it has such a dedicated audience to this very day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrJmSmrmtrYyrpqyrlaG5qrrIZqSorpmawG6tzZ1kra5dqLWww9Jmm56ZpJ16o7HCqKSeq12dsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-raquel-leviss-divorced-with-james-kennedy-breakup-reason-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Raquel Leviss Divorced With James Kennedy?
