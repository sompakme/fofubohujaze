I’m gonna take the kids or the kid or whatever for the weekend,’ or ‘You know what? You go somewhere,’” the former ‘NSync member, 43, explained during an episode of the <a href=#>“How Men Think” podcast</a> earlier this month. “Give each spouse a chance to kind of recharge their batteries. Because nobody’s perfect. We get angry, we do this, we do that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Joey-Fatone-Reveals-What-He-Learned-From-His-Divorce.jpg><p>Fatone admitted that he did not understand Baldwin’s side of things in the <a href=#>early days of coparenting</a>. “We all need downtime to ourselves, whether that be either watching TiVo all day, going to play golf, going to a hotel and reading a book,” he noted. “Whatever in that sense may be your Zen, I think it does give the other person a break, and I never noticed that when I was younger because I was always <a href=#>traveling with ‘NSync</a>. My ex was always with the kids, and it was always, ‘Well, the kids did this and this and that,’ and [I was] always like, ‘Yeah, yeah, but you can deal with it.’ It’s not that easy.”</p><p>After his split, the&nbsp;Common Knowledge&nbsp;host realized how demanding juggling his personal and professional lives could be. “Especially when I got divorced, I became Mom and Dad when I got home, so when I’m home by myself, legit, pardon my French, but I’m like, ‘Oh s—t. I gotta cook, I’ve gotta get them ready for school, I have to make sure the house is livable,’” he shared.</p><p>Fatone confirmed that <a href=#>he and Baldwin are “100 percent” divorced now</a>.&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;broke the news in June 2019 that the pair were “separated [and] going through a divorce.” He filed the papers in May 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>&nbsp;alum and the screenwriter married in September 2004. They are parents of daughters Briahna, 19, and Kloey, 10.</p><p>Fatone <a href=#>moved on with girlfriend <strong>Izabel Araujo</strong></a> in October 2014. He revealed on the “How Men Think” podcast that he waited nearly two years to introduce her to his children “just to know 100 percent that [the relationship was] gonna be right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Wueqet06ilnmWimsOmrcusZLCgkal6qbGMpZyaqp6asW6y0aikZqCZqHqltdWoqZydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-chris-evans-having-a-midlife-crisis-thanks-to-this-ex-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Is Chris Evans Having A Midlife Crisis Thanks To This Ex-Girlfriend?</span></a>
