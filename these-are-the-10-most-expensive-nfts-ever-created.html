However, that doesn't seem to stop the world from going digital all the same. People can see the effects of this new wave on the financial system just by following <a href=#>cryptocurrency trends which even some celebrities invest in</a>.&nbsp;But what is an NFT exactly? Well, an NFT, or non-fungible token, acts as a record on a crypto blockchain. It is like digital currency with a specific artwork attached instead of physical money and for that reason, a lot of investors can easily own portfolio, even <a href=#>celebrities have their own NFT portfolios</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The owner of the NFT can transfer or sell it within that particular chain. However, these crypto assets are based on each blockchain's technology, meaning someone cannot sell or trade them off to a different crypto blockchain.&nbsp;Anyone can invest in NFTs. The problem is how much they are willing to spend to own digital art. Ever wondered how much some of these NFTs were sold for? Keep reading to find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Inside Project Black: The World’s First Supercar Ownership NFT Series" href=#>Inside Project Black: The World’s First Supercar Ownership NFT Series</a></span></p><h2 id=cryptopunk-3100>CryptoPunk #3100</h2><p>CryptoPunks was one of the first NFTs designed on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2017, Larva Labs developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson created CryptoPunk. Their experimentation sparked the modern Crypto Art trend, where no two Crypto characters are exactly alike. CryptoPunks, in general, are considered some of the most expensive NFTs ever sold. The CryptoPunk #3100, a rare alien avatar with a white and blue headband, is just one of the 450 punks with headbands. No wonder it sold for $7.6 million!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cryptopunk-5577>CryptoPunk #5577</h2><p>When Larva Labs started their venture into the NFT market, they generated a 10,000-piece collection of characters, each with a unique design just like <a href=#>the unique fashion concept of Suitsupply</a>. The creators stated that their iconic 8-bit-style design was inspired by the 1970s London Punk movement, an era filled with misfits and nonconformists. The CryptoPunk #5577, which features an ape with a cowboy hat, was purchased by the founder of the Compound DeFi protocol, Robert Leshner, for $7.7 million in February of this year. Robert even announced his new token on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cryptopunk-4156>CryptoPunk #4156</h2><p>One of the most expensive NFTs ever made, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CryptoPunk #4156</a>, was sold for $10.26 million in 2021. The NFT, an ape with a blue bandana, is part of the 24 ape designs in CryptoPunk's extraordinary collection. This makes CryptoPunk #4156 an extremely rare and valuable find. It was also once owned by a collector named Punk4156. It was reported that Punk4156 sold the NFT because they were disappointed with the way Larva Labs handled issues regarding intellectual property rights and ownership.</p><h2 id=tpunk-3442>TPunk #3442</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tron Punks, or TPunks, launched their own NFT project on the Tron Blockchain, the first on their decentralized finance ecosystem. Owned by Justin Sun, TPunks presents its users with lower fees and the ability to create unique items to sell on the marketplace. Essentially, it guarantees faster and cheaper transactions compared to its rivals. For example, TPunk #3442, a token that resembles The Joker, the <a href=#>character that Joaquin Phoenix is known for</a>, was sold for $10.5 million during a sale. The buyer was Justin Sun himself. He eventually donated the token to the APENFT marketplace.</p><h2 id=alien-cryptopunk-7523>Alien CryptoPunk #7523</h2><p>Another entry for the most expensive NFT sold comes from CryptoPunks. Alien CryptoPunk #7523 is one of the nine Alien designs minted by its creator, Larva Labs. Its token comes with exclusive accessories, such as earrings, knitted caps, and masks. Alien CryptoPunk #7523, also dubbed the COVID Alien, was created during the height of the pandemic in June 2021. It is also the only alien token wearing a mask. This particular NFT was auctioned at Sotheby's and bought by Shalom Meckenzie for $11.75 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cryptopunk-5822>CryptoPunk #5822</h2><p>CryptoPunks are notoriously known for their record-breaking price tags, and with good reason. As pioneers of the Crypto Art trend, their NFT projects are likely to be quickly claimed by anyone with an Ethereum wallet and sell out in a matter of minutes. CryptoPunk #5822 is no different. It is part of Larva Labs' rare alien edition designs, making it extremely valuable. The token was bought for over $23.7 million, making it the most expensive CryptoPunk on this list. Deepak Thapliyal, CEO of Chain, made the hefty purchase.</p><h2 id=human-one>Human One</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next NFT on our list is a design made by American artist Michael Joseph Winkelmann, also known as Beeple. Beeple is a digital artist, graphic designer, and animator also known for selling NFTs. He is known to create numerous NFTs and some of them were included in <a href=#>the Highest Selling NFT Artwork</a> in history. He created Human One, which sold for a staggering $28.9 million at a Christie's auction in 2021. The artwork is a mix of physical and digital technology and features an astronaut walking through various projected landscapes. Additionally, Beeple maintains command over the display via remote control.</p><h2 id=clock>Clock</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Clock NFT is a token dedicated to a social cause. It is a co-creation of Julian Assange, Wikileaks founder, and Pak, the digital artist behind the design. The symbolism of the clock depicts Julian's number of days spent behind bars at London's Belmarsh Prison. It was sold for $52.7 million in February of this year to AssangeDAO, a decentralized social organization. The funds raised from the NFT will go toward Julian's defense fund and aim to help him be free from incarceration.</p><h2 id=the-first-5000-days>The First 5000 Days</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The First 5000 Days is another NFT created by digital artist Beeple. This design made him a household name in the world of NFTs. The artwork features 5000 pictures, taken one per day over the course of 13 years. His artworks can be compared to that of <a href=#>Van Gogh's most expensive paintings</a> when it comes to value. The NFT was purchased for a record-breaking $69.3 million by Singapore-based crypto investor, Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as MetaKovan. Reportedly, the main themes behind the NFT include society's obsession with technology and America's recent political turbulence.</p><h2 id=the-merge>The Merge</h2><p>Last but not the least, we have The Merge as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most expensive NFT ever created</a>. The design features a series of NFTs, made by digital artist Pak. It was bought by over 28,983 people who pooled in money to grab a total of 312,000 shares for over $91.8 million. The starting price for each piece was sold for only $575 but the value is said to increase by $25 every six hours. This NFT made Pak the most valuable living artist in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="This Is How Much Logan Paul's Total NFT Collection Is Worth" href=#>This Is How Much Logan Paul's Total NFT Collection Is Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Binance Academy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Globe News Wire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbHSnmSaqpViwamxjGpnZqWfqMFusdepnKermauybrrFrapmnaaav26v0Z6YrZ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./surya-bonaly-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Surya Bonaly Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
