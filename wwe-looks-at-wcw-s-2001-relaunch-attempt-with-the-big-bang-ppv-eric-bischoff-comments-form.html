We couldn’t reach into the trash, pick out the crumbled and trampled creative — that had been WCW for the last year-and-a-half — and try to make people feel good about that again. In order for the relaunch to feel like one, it had to go away. The thinking was, let’s get people talking about the new WCW and what it was going to look like and feel like.”</p><p>AOL Time Warner, however, pulled the plug on WCW’s TV clearance, and the entire deal fell apart.</p><p>The WWE.com article added that the voice of ECW (which was done at that point), Joey Styles, was in talks to come on board to be the voice of the newly launched WCW, and Styles even met with Bischoff in New York City.</p><p>“I would be the lead announcer and I would work in digital media,” Styles said. “I did not agree to do this with Eric until it was obvious that ECW was finished.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpZva25rXazEpnnLqKakq12XrqS3jJqrZq%2BTrMBufo9paGaqlaGutrrCoWSarKSaurHAjLCgraBdqbWmecGinmaakaO0brzPr2SeqpmYeqO10pyfqJ6WYrCwucyepa2rXZu8s7nEq2Sem6dirq%2B6zq6lnJ2iYq6tuc6sq2ahnqu8rcLEnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woody-wright-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Woody Wright Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
