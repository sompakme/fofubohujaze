The Disney Channel series, which ran for three seasons, followed the twins as they resided and goofed off in Boston’s Tipton Hotel.</p><p>While their mom, Carey Martin (<strong>Kim Rhodes</strong>), performed at the hotel, the boys got into trouble with the help of London Tipton (<a href=#><strong>Brenda Song</strong></a>), whose dad owned the place, and teenage employee Maddie Fitzpatrick (<a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a>).</p><p>The Sprouse siblings continued to thrive on the network with their spinoff series, The Suite Life on Deck, which lasted three seasons from 2008 to 2011. Although the actors <a href=#>took a break from Hollywood to attend college</a> — before returning to the entertainment space in the late 2010s — both Cole and Dylan still hold a torch for their Disney days.</p><p>“It was so long ago that the cold open of the pilot episode was Cole searching for non-existent armpit hair on me,” <a href=#>Dylan wrote via Instagram in March 2020</a> alongside a photo of his brother looking under his armpit in the show’s pilot episode in honor of its 15-year anniversary. “A lot had happened in our lives that was difficult then and this show, in a way, saved us. 1000 years of gratitude to all involved.”</p><p>The Banana Split actor concluded: “I love you all and I’m glad this show can still give families the nostalgia they once had when watching it. <a href=#>I’ll keep those memories forever</a>.”</p><p>The following year, Cole revealed that he too had a soft spot for Suite Life after finding success on The CW’s <a href=#>Riverdale</a> beginning in 2017.</p><p>“I know it sounds cheesy, I still have a really deep fondness for The Suite Life,” Cole confessed during a March 2021 episode of <a href=#>Vogue’s “73 Questions.”</a></p><p>The photographer later revealed that “when I’m drunk or feeling really narcissistic” he does watch old episodes of the series.</p><p>Tisdale, meanwhile, has given fans glimpses inside her friendship with the Sprouse twins over the years, <a href=#>including a 2015 reunion</a> which she shared on Instagram.</p><p>Years later, the <a href=#>High School Musical</a> star dished on which brother she would “spend three months in a remote location with” — and why texting played a role in her decision.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You know, they’re both like my little brothers,” Tisdale said with a laugh in December 2019 <a href=#>during a game of Elle’s “Thirst Trap”</a> when asked to pick a twin. “You know who texts me back all the time? Dylan Sprouse. He’s the one who texts me back. Cole, sometimes [gives me] silence. So, I’m taking Dylan. That’s for ghosting on me Cole!”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Suite Life of Zack & Cody are doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowqrAxGajop6VYrynedmamqRlkaOxbq%2FOnbBmm5GowW7Dx56pnmWRp7JuwMeesGamn6x8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stevie-j-s-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Stevie Js net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
