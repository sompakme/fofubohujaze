You told Cameron and [then] Cameron lied about it. We were in the hot tub together. Cameron, is it true or is it not?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MAFS-Clare-Claims-Emily-s-Ex-Brennan-Wanted-to-Have-Sex-With-Her-Friend.jpg><p class=p1>She continued, “I don’t expect you to tell the truth at this point. I don’t.”</p><p class=p1>Cameron was confused at Clare’s allegations, and Clare then clarified her accusation to note that Brennan was “f—king other people.”</p><p class=p1>“First I wanted to f—k other people, then you just said now I actually did f—k someone else. Which one is it?” Brennan replied, denying the accusations. “I never f—ked anyone [and] I never said that I wanted to f—k anyone. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p class=p1>Clare stressed that “either way” Brennan had been married at the time before Emily, 29, chimed in. According to Emily, her now-ex claimed he also wanted to “f—k [her] best friend” and told <a href=#>costars</a> Cameron and <strong>Austin Reed</strong> about his feelings.</p><p class=p1>“You just admitted before that rumor was clearly not true,” Brennan said to his ex in the clip.</p><p class=p1>Brennan and Emily were matched on season 17 of <i>Married at First Sight, </i>which was set in Denver. While Emily was immediately drawn to her stranger spouse, revealing on their wedding day that he was her physical type, Brennan did not feel the same and was hesitant to move in with Emily to a shared apartment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>At one point during the season, Clare — in the middle of her separation from Cameron early on the season — confessed that she heard that the two men were planning to go on a double date. During the gossip session, Clare inferred that the date was happening soon. Cameron and Brennan, meanwhile, later asserted during a cast gathering that they were making a potential plan once both divorces were finalized.</p><p class=p1>During the first part of the season 17 reunion on April 10, Emily accused Brennan of <a href=#>being “controlling”</a> during their marriage and saying “hurtful things.” He did apologize for his actions, claiming he “didn’t express [himself] in a way that was conducive to [them] ending or staying together.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>The <i>Married at First Sight </i>season 17 reunion continues on Lifetime Wednesday, April 10, at 8 p.m. ET.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSanqNiv6bBzaKmp2WToa6zsYyco5qhnah6o77Ep6Wapl2Ytaat056bZqeeYrKutcuyZJudlqS%2FpnnDoq2oqpOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-cattrall-mourns-death-of-mom-shane-at-93-rest-in-peace-mum.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Cattrall Mourns Death of Mom Shane at 93: 'Rest in Peace Mum'</span></a>
