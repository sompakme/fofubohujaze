I was like, ‘Wow, what if I can get this one day?’ Some woman walking by said, ‘That’s not impossible.’ I said, ‘But I’m talking about me.’ She said, ‘Yeah, and I’m telling you it’s not impossible. It might be improbable, but not impossible.’ And now, here it is — so many years later, and I’m getting that star on Hollywood Boulevard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BUC_9724.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 13-time Grammy nominee spoke of his “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234829753>Superman</a>“-esque story. During his <a rel=nofollow href=#>ascent within music</a>, he found himself addicted to drugs, and later homeless, living on the very streets where his Walk of Fame star now lays.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That was my <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234764773>rock bottom</a> time,” he reflected. “And once you’re on that curve, ain’t but one way back, and that’s up. So I prayed, ‘Lord, it’s too crowded down here, please take me up off this curve.’” However, his now-wife Mahin helped him become sober after they met in the rehab facility where she worked back in 1995. Wilson has since been clean for nearly 30 years, survived prostate cancer, and ultimately, changed his life for the better.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During the ceremony, Snoop, Babyface, <a href=# id=auto-tag_pharrell data-tag=pharrell>Pharrell</a>, and Wilson’s longtime manager, Michael Paran, all gave emotional anecdotes about their distinct relationships with the “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234762187>There Goes My Baby</a>” crooner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MAB1276.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Snoop discussed the moment when Mahin pulled him aside during a recording session, telling him to cut back on his marijuana usage around the singer. “‘Nobody can smoke if Charlie is in the studio,'” the rapper recalled, mimicking Mahin’s voice. “So, the first day we was like ‘man who is this lady tryna tell us what to do? We smokin’ homie. We doin’ what we wanna do. Kick rocks with all that.’ Second day, she pulled me to the side and she talked to me like my mother […] and she put so much respect in me [that] we didn’t smoke around Charlie Wilson when he was working with us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On a separate occasion, Wilson told him not to smoke around the children he coached on a youth football team. So, Snoop quit for 120 days.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He later expressed, “This man means the world to me—not just musically, but personally […] The things you taught me: showmanship, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234774857>business</a>, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234844183>family</a>—that’s a treasure to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MAB1203.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Terry Lewis considered Wilson to be “one of the<a href=#> greatest vocalists</a> God ever created” as Jimmy Jam dubbed him a “divine artist.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Babyface reflected on how Bobby Brown’s “<a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234665121>Rock Wit’cha</a>” was almost a Charlie Wilson record, how he is still a generational teacher, and how Wilson is one of the few people he gets “geeked” about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BUC_9304.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pharrell couldn’t be there in-person, but a special video message was played from the Neptunes superstar. “Thank you for continually inspiring us—song after song, run after run,” said the 50-year-old. “It’s incredible what you’re able to do. Like, you’re still crushing it. You absolutely deserve this star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Wilson spoke on his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234748548>longevity</a> before concluding his own speech. “I’m still here to be able to <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234734295>tell my story</a> and be able to dance and sing and <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234653354>have a good time </a>on the stage,” he stated. “All the things I’ve ever prayed for, they all came to pass. I really sort of am Superman — I’m faster than all of the speeding bullets that came after me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the full ceremony below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1or7Lopxmr5mhwLC6jKGmpaSprLywsIywmKWjXaSzbrLAppxmm5Wnsq67zbJkampjaYV1gpBpa2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bre-tiesi-says-selling-sunset-cut-full-fight-with-cassandra-dawn.html><span>←</span><span>Bre Tiesi Says 'Selling Sunset' Cut Full Fight With Cassandra Dawn</span></a>
