And as it turns out, there’s one detail that’s been raising some eyebrows.</p><h2 id=she-believes-in-giving-her-skin-lsquo-a-break-rsquo-when-she-rsquo-s-not-on-camera>She Believes In Giving Her Skin ‘A Break’ When She’s Not On Camera</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chan is often recognized for both her incredible work and her flawless skin, so much so that she was announced as the newest spokesperson for L’Oréal Paris in 2020. “Gemma Chan is proof of the success that happens when you have the confidence to follow your own dreams, and speak up for others to be able to follow theirs. Committed to her causes with innate female strength, she's a source of inspiration beyond the screen, for young women to be the change,” L'Oréal Paris’ global brand president, Delphine Viguier-Hovasse, said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a statement</a>. “We're delighted to welcome Gemma to the family.”</p><p>On Chan’s part, it takes some work to keep her skin youthful, especially when production work typically comes with heavy makeup requirements. And so, Chan often makes sure that her skin has time to breathe when she’s not on set. “I think it’s nice to give your skin a break,” the actress explained during an interview with Huffington Post. “Especially at the moment as I am having to wear a lot heavier makeup than I normally would, so I have to be extra disciplined about making sure to take everything off at night.” As it turns out, this was something that she learned from her mother. “You should never go to bed with your make-up on,” Chan told British Vogue. “Always cleanse, tone and moisturise. It doesn’t matter how tipsy you might be or what time you got back in, always take your make-up off.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Kumail Nanjiani Did To Get Into Shape For The MCU's 'Eternals'</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Chan also believes in keeping things simple when it comes to her skincare routine. In fact, the actress often opts for skincare products straight out of a British pharmacy. “"I swear by Boots No. 7 for their skin creams. I use their Protect and Perfect Intense Advanced Serum as well as their Early Defence Day Cream,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chan once told Allure</a>. “I use their Protect and Perfect Night Cream as well. It’s effective, super affordable. I also use the Simple Micellar Wipes. They’re great because they don’t leave an oily residue on my skin, which I can’t stand.”</p><h2 id=she-found-her-beauty-routine-uplifting-during-quarantine>She Found Her Beauty Routine Uplifting During Quarantine</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like much of Hollywood and the rest of the world, Chan found herself on her own a lot of times during lockdown. At first, she utilized the time to chill out and just let her hair down. “Initially when we were all locked down I loved not putting on make-up and giving my skin a break, but then I got a bit too lazy with it, not plucking my eyebrows and all of that,” the actress revealed while speaking with Harper’s Bazaar. But then, Chan reached a “tipping point.”</p><p>“I realised I’d reached a tipping point, that actually I’d feel better if I brushed my hair, blow-dried it,” the actress explained. “Doing those things and those little rituals do actually cheer you up.” At the same time, it also certain that the actress continued with a certain beauty routine that has intrigued some in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-her-beauty-secret-that-raises-eyebrows>Here’s Her Beauty Secret That Raises Eyebrows</h2><p>For a myriad of reasons, eyes can sometimes get puffy. And especially for actresses like Chan, it’s important to keep those bags under the eyes under control. Hence, she doesn’t take any chances and readily relies on a massaging tool that she keeps on hand. The thing is, it also resembles a pleasure device.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Eternals': Marvel Fans Obsessed With Angelina Jolie’s Action Sequences In New Trailer</a></span></p><p>“When my eyes get puffy, I pull out my Foreo Iris massager — it mimics the tapping used in traditional Asian skin care,” Chan revealed while speaking with InStyle. “It looks like a vibrator, so I call it my 'eyebrator.' I get funny looks when I use it in the back of a car or when I go through customs at the airport, but it's so soothing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Foreo Iris massager readily mimics the lympathic eye massages that are common in Asia. Using two modes, it helps remove dark circles and bags under the eyes. At the same time, the massager can also reportedly remove fine lines, thereby helping keep one’s face youthful looking. Aside from Chan, Paris Hilton is also a huge fan of this massager.</p><p>Fans can expect to see Chan (in all her glowing beauty) in the upcoming Marvel movie Eternals. The film is slated for release on November 5, 2021.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>A Sneak Peek Into Kumail Nanjiani's Body Transformation For Marvel's 'Eternals'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnp6lnZZ6pLTAp6pmmpWWwrXFjKycnKqVqXqzrcisnKxlla6yo77OsKpmZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cynthia-nixon-reveals-why-miranda-has-gray-hair-in-satc-revival.html><span>←</span><span>Cynthia Nixon Reveals Why Miranda Has Gray Hair in SATC Revival</span></a>
