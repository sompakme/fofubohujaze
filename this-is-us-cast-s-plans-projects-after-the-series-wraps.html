Brown</strong></a> also guest-starred on.</p><p>The actor had a <a href=#>one-night stand</a> with Midge in a funny opening sequence during season 4. Sherman-Palladino called it “the worst” type of role to cast because it’s a brief but memorable part.</p><p>“For one sequence you need like that handsome, charming, great guy, which is the hardest thing in the world to find,” she<a href=#> told Us Weekly exclusively</a> in February 2022. “And we’re like, ‘We gotta bring in f–king Milo, right? And we always use Milo as [an example], like, ‘You know, like Milo.’ And, and then it’s like, ‘No, wait minute, why don’t we actually try to get Milo?’”</p><p>The actor was “so handsome and lovely” in his brief role on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel that he’ll return for the show’s <a href=#>fifth and final season</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>, who has played Kevin Pearson on This Is Us, has many projects lined up after <a href=#>the NBC drama wraps</a>. In September 2021, CBS announced that the actor will lead The Never Game, a TV adaptation of <strong>Jeffrey Deaver</strong>‘s novel.</p><p>“I couldn’t be happier that The Never Game is coming to CBS, and that Colter Shaw will be brought to life on screen soon,” the Hunt actor said in a statement. “When I read the book, I was immediately drawn to the character and the story; developing this project with Ken has been a true labor of love. Colter is going to kick some serious ass, and I can’t wait for audiences to meet him.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Chrissy Metz</strong></a>, for her part, is also excited to <a href=#>continue acting and playing music</a> when the show wraps. While she exclusively told Us Weekly in July 2021 that she never wants to give up acting for good, she’s looking forward to finally being able to release her personal new album — especially if it helps others.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I just know from <a href=#>every experience I’ve had</a> — whether it’s a terrible audition, a terrible date, a bad relationship, whatever — people learn and grow from other people’s experiences,” the Golden Globe nominee told Us at the time. “I love this wave that’s happening on Instagram. I literally follow people who make cookies, psychologists and therapists. That’s about all I follow and maybe <strong>Lizzo</strong>! I’m learning so much from the way that other people are processing their trauma and their issues. We aren’t taught that, and we don’t know how to do it. … I’m like, ‘Wow, the more honest I am, the more growth and healing there can be.’ It’s healing for me.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see what the cast is planning next:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bptaq%2FjKKqZq2jYrCiv9OsZKmkkaPAbrzRqKGem6SoeqKy056pZqyYmnq0sdGinKxlp6eusb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamar-braxton-joins-dish-nation-as-host.html><span>←</span><span>Tamar Braxton Joins Dish Nation As Host</span></a>
