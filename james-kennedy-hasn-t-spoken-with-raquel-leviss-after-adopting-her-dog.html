<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>James Kennedy Hasn't Spoken With Raquel Leviss After Adopting Her Dog</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong> </a>and <strong>Ally Lewber</strong> are having a blast as a family of five (which includes three fur babies).</p><p>During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly at <a href=#>BravoCon</a> on Saturday, November 4, James, 31, and Ally, 27, discussed how dog Hippie <a href=#>has adjusted to living with them and their two cats.</a></p><p>“[He is] so good. He’s amazing,” James gushed before Ally added, “He’s so great. I love him. He’s so happy and we have a yard. He’s been a great boy.”</p><p>After adopting the dog earlier this summer, James confirmed to Us that he hasn’t had any contact with ex <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>, who was Hippie’s previous owner.</p><p><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> viewers were introduced to Hippie <a href=#>when he was still called Graham Cracker</a>. During James and Raquel’s relationship, the former beauty pageant queen, 29, <a href=#>got the pet as a gift from her parents</a>. Raquel initially remained Graham’s primary guardian after <a href=#>ending her engagement to James in late 2021.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie.jpg><p>Earlier this year, Raquel made headlines for having an affair with costar <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>, which ended his nearly decade-long romance with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>. Raquel <a href=#>checked herself into a mental health facility</a> in the aftermath of the drama. While fans assumed that Raquel’s dog was in her family’s possession amid her 90-day stay, James later revealed <a href=#>he was looking after Graham now.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie-2.jpg><p>“Look who made his way back home, back into my life. I’ll take care of you forever, and I love you,” James captioned a July Instagram photo of him filming season 11 with his dog, <a href=#>who he later renamed Hippie</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> claimed at the time that her Vanderpump Dogs Rescue organization received word that the dog was in a rescue center, which is how James was able to gain custody. Raquel’s mother, Laura, however, clarified that <a href=#>an incident led to the decision to surrender</a> Graham to trainers at California Doodle Rescue. They later contacted Lisa, 63, without Laura’s knowledge or approval.</p><p>One month later, Raquel offered her side of the story about <a href=#>what led to Graham getting rehomed.</a></p><p>“There’s a lot more to this story, but Graham, my gosh. He has a history of aggression and he’s bitten me really hard. I already was considering getting a foster family while going into [the mental health facility] the Meadows and trying it out,” she said on <a href=#><strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong></a>‘s iHeartRadio’s “ReWives” podcast in August.</p><p>Raquel claimed there was “a reason why” <a href=#>she didn’t want James to look after the dog</a>, adding, “He doesn’t have dog experience and he’s part of the reason why Graham is a biter. James would encourage Graham to bite his hands hard, and he liked that sensation, so of course that trained Graham to be a biter.”</p><p>According to Raquel, the choice to <a href=#>find Graham a new home came after she exhausted</a> other options.</p><p>“My dog Graham bit my mom’s hand down to the bone, and it was so bad she couldn’t even get stitches. I had the decision to either leave the Meadows and go back and take care of my dog, or try to get him rehomed and finish out my treatment, because I knew I had more to work on,” she continued. “So I chose myself and we researched a breed-specific dog rescue, and they took him in besides his biting behavior. Bottom line, he couldn’t get rehomed.”</p><p>The former reality star, who has since <a href=#>announced her departure from Vanderpump Rules</a>, was surprised to hear Lisa got involved with rehoming Graham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/James-Kennedy-Ex-Raquel-Leviss-After-Adopting-Dog-Hippie-4.jpg><p>“It was supposed to be a confidential, anonymous [decision] because it’s nobody else’s business,” she added at the time. “I thought it was a joke at first [when I saw Graham with James]. My heart dropped to my stomach. There was a picture of James walking Graham, and I was like, ‘No.’ Immediately, my mom called the foster who was working with Graham, and she said, ‘Oh, it’s so lovely. Lisa adopted him.’ So now the narrative is, I dumped my dog at a shelter and he was hours away from being euthanized and that’s not true.”</p><p>Although Raquel has taken a step back from filming, James has enjoyed <a href=#>being in the spotlight after filming season 11.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The vibe was pretty intense after [our Vanderpump Rules panel]. I don’t think Sandoval had too much fun up there. I was having a great time,” James joked with Us after joining his costars onstage at BravoCon on Friday, November 3. “But yeah, it was an intense panel. … But we all got through it and I did think there were some funny parts.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGapZWoeqyxzaecnbFdna60utNmqqmnm5q7bsPIrZ9mqpGmwqa4jKWcr6GjqHqistOeqWaZlKS9tbXNoGShnaJisbCzjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golden-boy-promotions-owner-oscar-de-la-hoya-planning-mega-fight-with-floyd-mayweather-in-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Golden Boy Promotions Owner Oscar De La Hoya Planning Mega-Fight With Floyd Mayweather In 2022</span></a>
