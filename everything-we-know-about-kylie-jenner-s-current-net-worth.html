The reality television show that was <a href=#>originally just a marketing tactic, Keeping Up with the Kardashians,</a> catapulted her and her family to widespread fame.</p><p>Growing up on the show, she shared personal moments, family dynamics and milestones, allowing viewers to witness her transformation from adolescence to adulthood. <strong>This led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie making $5 million per episode,</a> starting at the age of 10 years old.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the show moved from E! to Hulu and got a new name, The Kardashians, Kylie's payday went up.

In 2015, at the age of 18, Kylie launched Kylie Lip Kits, which later evolved into Kylie Cosmetics. The brand's initial launch of lip kits sold out within minutes, capitalizing on Kylie's massive online presence and the burgeoning popularity of her signature plump lips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lip kits proved to do so well that within the first 18 months of the company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Cosmetics' revenue was valued at $400 million.</a><strong>In two years, the company had brought in a total of $630 million and by 2017, an additional $330 was earned.</strong></p><p>The success of Kylie Cosmetics can be attributed to her strategic use of social media, her personal brand, and the power of influencer marketing. Over the years, the brand expanded its offerings beyond lip kits to include a wide range of makeup products. In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie sold a majority stake (51% of her company) to Coty Inc. for $600 million</a>, valuing the brand at approximately $1.2 billion at that time.</p><p>However, Kylie has reportedly been unhappy with the way that Coty has been handling the brand. As such, <a href=#>Kylie has allegedly been in talks to try to buy back the majority share</a>. But with disagreements over valuation, this has proven to be hard to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-branched-out-with-kylie-skin><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kylie Jenner Branched Out With Kylie Skin</span></h2><h3 id=kylie-jenner-sold-kylie-skin-as-part-of-the-600-million-deal-with-coty-inc>Kylie Jenner sold Kylie Skin as part of the $600 million deal with Coty, Inc.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-2.png><ul><li><strong>Jenner is looking to buy back her majority shares from Coty, Inc.</strong></li></ul><p>While Kylie Cosmetics remains her most well-known business, Kylie Jenner has diversified her portfolio. Building on the success of Kylie Cosmetics, she launched Kylie Skin in 2019, a line of skincare products. The skincare line includes a variety of products such as cleansers, moisturizers, face masks, and serums.</p><p>Kylie Skin quickly gained popularity and became a successful addition to her brand, attracting a new customer base interested in skincare. With the launch of Kylie Skin, Kylie Jenner has firmly established her position as a beauty mogul with a diverse range of products catering to different beauty needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, as part of the sale of her business, Kylie Cosmetics, Kylie also sold Kylie Skin to Coty.
