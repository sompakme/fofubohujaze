At the end of the day, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">basics are great</a> because of their versatility. They’re seriously reliable, and some of them can be styled in multiple ways.</p><p>If you want to add a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seriously affordable staple top</a> to your rotation, we found the ultimate option. Countless shoppers are raving about what a steal it is, and best of all, it’s a two-in-one situation. You can wear it as a low-key sports bra or team it with some high-waisted shorts for a casual brunch look!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HATOPANTS-Womens-Cotton-Racerback-Basic-Crop-Tank-Tops.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">HATOPANTS Women’s Cotton Racerback Basic Crop Tank Top</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$9</a>, available at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, July 9, 2021, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>This might be one of the most affordable fashion finds that we’ve seen recently. It’s incredibly form-fitting so you can potentially get away with wearing it without a bra, which is ideal for a summer sweat session. The more layers we can shed to keep cool in the heat, the better! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The top</a> has a simple racerback design that’s flattering on a variety of body types. If you’re going out, it can pair perfectly with practically any type of bottom — be it relaxed denim or an ornate maxi skirt!</p><p>As mentioned, you can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wear this top</a> as a sports bra for any type of low-impact workout. It might not be supportive enough if you’re heading to a cycling class, but multiple shoppers said they opted to layer a bra underneath ahead of exercising. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HATOPANTS-Womens-Cotton-Racerback-Basic-Crop-Tank-Tops-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">HATOPANTS Women’s Cotton Racerback Basic Crop Tank Top</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$9</a>, available at Amazon!
