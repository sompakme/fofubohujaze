We know a little bit about him, but we don’t really know him. In Tom’s situation, there is a certain amount of unknown that spurs on curiosity.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bradshaw continued, “I want him to be great, and I think he will be. But we don’t know enough about him. Will we see a different side? Will he be funny? Will he be witty? Will he break the game down properly? I’m pulling for him, because television is not easy. You can’t lie to the camera because it picks it up.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Terry-Bradshaws-Advice-for-Tom-Brady-Super-Bowl-Predictions-And-His-New-Singing-Career.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>There are fewer concerns on Bradshaw’s end about the upcoming TV debut of <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, who will join ESPN’s <i>Monday Night Countdown</i> when the NFL season kicks off later this year. Kelce, 36, announced his retirement in March after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“He’s the kind of personality that television takes to,” Bradshaw gushed. “He’s quick, he’s witty, he’s funny, he’s likable, he’s knowledgeable. You’re comfortable when you listen to him. You like him.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>During his first season on the job, Brady will have the responsibility of calling the Super Bowl in 2025. When that time comes, Bradshaw argued, the Kansas City Chiefs won’t be there trying to become the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in a row.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Kansas City will have a problem. I don’t think they’ll do it,” Bradshaw said. “They had a hard time last year during the regular season. Because what happens is once you have all that success, you can very easily get bored by the regular season. I thought last year was a good example. They struggled all year and turned it on in the playoffs. This year it will be even more of that.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>However, Bradshaw joked, “If they do it, that will be good for Fox because we’re doing the game and that will be a great story.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Terry-Bradshaws-Advice-for-Tom-Brady-Super-Bowl-Predictions-And-His-New-Singing-Career-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>In the meantime, Bradshaw is reveling in the experience of taking his acclaimed stage production, The Terry Bradshaw Show, on the road. The show tells Bradshaw’s life story through comedy, storytelling and, to the surprise of many, Bradshaw’s singing voice. The tour includes stops at Margaritaville Resort Casino in <a href=# rel=noopener>Bossier City, Louisiana</a> on Saturday, July 13, Wind Creek Event Center in <a href=# rel=noopener>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a> on Saturday, July 20 and Hard Rock Hotel & Casino <a href=# rel=noopener>Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> on Friday, July 26.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“When I found my voice, that’s when going on stage became so much fun,” Bradshaw explained. “I can see it in people’s faces. They’re shocked that I can sing. I enjoy that a lot.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The show has seen many different iterations over the years, with Bradshaw describing the current version of the production as the most free-wheeling, spontaneous experience yet.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“There’s no structure to it,” Bradshaw said. “I may go too long with the audience and have too much fun. I may leave out songs, I may add songs, I may talk too long. It’s just kind of how it is. But that’s kind of how my life is.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnaKnxm6u0ZqbrKCRrHqisNWiqp6rXam8rnnBq5idsV2Wu6V5w6KqoZ2jYryvecKhoJ6eo2KAbrzEmqtmm5iWu6Sx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pope-francis-mic-checks-like-a-rapper-in-funny-viral-photos-reactions.html><span>←</span><span>Pope Francis Mic Checks Like a Rapper in Funny Viral Photos: Reactions</span></a>
