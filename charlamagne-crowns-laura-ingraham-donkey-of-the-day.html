During the 14 minute dragging, Uncle Charla praised Thomas for maintaining his cool during the exchange, but admitted he wouldn’t have done the same.</p><p>“One thing I’m not doing in my older age is explaining myself to culturally clueless, white people,” Charlamagne said. To illustrate how degrading hip-hop is, Ingragam recited (as best she could) the lyrics to JAY Z’s “Story of O.J,” which according to The Breakfast Club host only proved Thomas’ point.</p><p>“First off, Laura was too stupid to realize that the lyrics she decided to showcase from “The Story of O.J.” are proving Hov’s point just like Datwon said. JAY Z has evolved into a father, husband, businessman worth half a billion dollars, but Laura wants to paint him as a coke dealing, manager stabbing N-Word.”</p><p>The Black Privilege author also wasn’t too keen on Ingraham trying to make a connection between JAY Z and O.J. Simpson.</p><p>“Ms. Mayonaise listen. You know damn well Datwon was saying nothing in defense of O.J. You’re just trying to demonize all black men so you take a black man that white people demonize–and rightfully so–like O.J. Simpson and make a correlation that doesn’t exist between him and Hov,” Charlamagne said. “Datwon is absolutely right and it’s unfortunate they only picked those lyrics, but you know the picture they’re trying to paint. They’re trying to discredit and demonize two of our best and brightest and they just salty that they are nominated for Album of The Year and a white man isn’t.”</p><p>Listen to “Donkey of The Day” in its entirety below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1or7LmqSan56aerW0wGaeqJxdoa62vsBmoKefopa1ormMnaano5WuerCyjK2fnmWUlsZugZRrZ3FqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-urlacher-and-laurie-faulhaber.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Urlacher and Laurie Faulhaber</span></a>
