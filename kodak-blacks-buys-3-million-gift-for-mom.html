He said he filled the Birkin bag with $30,000 in cash as well, and surprised his mom with the house, the Birkin, and the stack of cash, as she returned from a trip to Haiti.</p><p>Black didn’t stop there. The No Flockin' rapper showed his inner circle some appreciation by gifting them each 3 Rolex’s “kuz they always on time,” and $15,000 in cash, “even tho that loyalty priceless.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loyalty might be priceless, but a losing bet on the Super Bowl sure cost the rapper a big chunk of change.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Aspiring Rapper & Husband Arrested For Laundering $4.5 Billion In Cryptocurrency</a></span></p><p>The rapper topped off his rough weekend by betting $30,000 on the Cincinnati Bengals, who threw the game in the final quarter, resulting in a big win for the Los Angeles Rams and a big loss for Black.</p><p>Black wasn't on Instagram just to brag about his lavish gift-giving, he also went on Live to show his fans the wounds he got during his “minor incident.” The rapper, <a href=#>who was counting stacks of cash</a>, paused for a moment to point the camera down at his leg to show an up-close look at his injury, which was covered in a bandage and rested in a brace.</p><p>Black’s attorney, Bradford Cohen, told NBC News on Monday that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the shooting began with an “unprovoked attack”</a> on someone Kodak was walking with. When the rapper and security came to the aid of that person, “several shots were fired at them by an unidentified assailant.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cohen said that Black would make a full recovery.</p><p>It's not known if he put the Rolex's on credit or if he had to get a mortgage for the mansion.
