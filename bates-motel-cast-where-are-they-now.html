The duo attempt to start fresh after his father’s sudden death but Norman’s deteriorating mental health causes complications.</p><p>The final season of the show loosely followed the plot of Psycho, which introduced Norman as an adult running the motel while secretly keeping his mother’s remains on the property. Bates Motel expanded on the world of Psycho by introducing new characters<a href=#> such as Norman’s half-brother, Dylan</a> (Thieriot), his best friend Emma (Cooke) and a love interest for Norma a.k.a Sheriff Alex Romero (<strong>Néstor Carbonell</strong>).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the finale, Highmore weighed in on <a href=#>a possible reunion in the future</a>, telling TVLine in 2017, “There’s no hope of coming back for another season or convincing people that we can just do a few more episodes at some point in the future [since Norman was killed at the end]. I’m not sure what the Christmas reunion would look like. Maybe Norma and Norman will be on a beach in Hawaii Heaven.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see where the cast of Bates Motel are now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXrrWx0makqKyVoXqkrdKtZLCglaeybq3RnmStoJWueq%2B71mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zack-de-la-rocha-wiki-bio-age-height-family-wife-inside-out-songs-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Zack de la Rocha Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Inside Out, Songs and Net Worth.</span></a>
