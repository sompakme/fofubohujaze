Here's a timeline and everything we know so far about their perplexing and tumultuous relationship.</p><h2 id=they-started-dating-in-2003><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Started Dating In 2003</span></h2><p>Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson and Vivica A. Fox started dating in 2003. Back then, 50 was enjoying the success of his debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin,' and the co-signs of two of the biggest rap stars at that time, Eminem and Dr. Dre. Accomplishment-wise, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' enjoyed what a hip-hop debutant could ever dream about: 872,000 first-week sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=at-the-time-fox-was-also-at-the-peak-of-her-acting-career><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>At The Time, Fox Was Also At The Peak Of Her Acting Career</span></h2><p>At the same time, Vivica A. Fox was also at the peak of her career. She's known for portraying Vernita Green in Quentin Tarantino's 2003 classic, Kill Bill and working in two box office hits Independence Day and Set It Off. Vivica A. Fox and 50 Cent's relationship seemed like a match-made-in-heaven at that time, as they were at the peak of their commercial careers in their respective expertise.</p><h2 id=after-their-relationship-ended-fox-addressed-it-on-tv><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>After Their Relationship Ended, Fox Addressed IT On TV</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, their relationship didn't last very long, and Vivica A. Fox was the first person who addressed the downfall publicly. In September 2005, she spoke to Tyra Banks about how she'd always been painted as the black sheep after the nasty breakup. Furthermore, she added that the rap star accused her of using their relationship as a publicity stunt. This is how everything started to fall apart.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Does 50 Cent Make His Money These Days?</a></span></p><h2 id=however-she-still-starred-in-50-cent-s-music-video><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>However, She Still Starred In 50 Cent's Music Video</span></h2><p>However, over the next few years leading up to 50's Before I Self Destruct album release, the rapper told Tyra Banks that the two had smoothed out their relationship. Later on, Vivica appeared in the rapper's music video for "Do You Think About Me" from the critically panned fourth studio album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-bad-blood-sparked-again-in-2015><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Their Bad Blood Sparked Again In 2015</span></h2><p>Not 5 years passed by, the feud sparked again. It started when 50 took a dig at her former boo's low-rated Empire series, which she starred in. It's also a rival to 50's Starz drama Power. He even went the extra mile by posting an unflattering photo of her on Instagram, captioning, "B—h remember when you told me f—k Halle Berry and you could have played all the roles she did better than her? And I just looked at you like what the f—k kind s—t did you take? LMAO."</p><h2 id=she-once-insinuated-that-50-was-gay><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Once&nbsp;Insinuated That 50 Was Gay</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later on, Vivica A. Fox made some unflattering comments about her ex-boyfriend's sexuality and insinuated that he was gay.</p><p>"What were your thoughts when 50 Cent blamed the season ratings dip on 'gay stuff'?," host Andy Cohen asked her about 50's comment regarding her show's rating. "First of all, you know the pot called the kettle black is all I'm saying," said the actress.</p><h2 id=she-spoke-about-him-in-her-book><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Spoke About Him In Her Book</span></h2><p>Furthermore, Fox added some more commentary about their relationship in her 2018 book, Every Day I'm Hustling, and the rapper wasn't happy about it. She described the couple's sex life as something "cherished and special," although most of them were "PG-13 rated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Most of the time, I would be the one initiating sex, because I really enjoyed making love with him," she wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Sits Idle As His Girlfriend And Ex Battle Hard</a></span></p><h2 id=he-once-was-so-close-to-proposing-her><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Once Was So Close to Proposing Her</span></h2><p>Another juicy detail we could gather from the book is that the rapper was so close to proposing to her for marriage. And then, it was the rapper who called it off before it happened. According to her, she "hogged the spotlight" because she sang at the event the two were at in Monaco. Therefore, he refrained from asking the sacred question. Imagine how different it would be now if he did pop the question.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=despite-everything-she-still-called-50-cent-the-love-of-her-life><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Despite Everything, She Still Called 50 Cent The 'Love' Of Her Life</span></h2><p>After everything that was said and done, Vivica A. Fox still spoke highly about the rapper. In a recent interview with DJ Vlad, she admitted that their decision of going public was "too soon" and called him the love of her life.</p><p>"The relationship broke up after the World Music Awards. I came back and he was on the radio saying he dumped me," she recalled.</p><h2 id=now-50-s-new-girl-has-something-to-say><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Now, 50's New Girl Has Something To Say</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, 50 has been in a relationship with a Cuban model, Jamira "Cuban Link" Haines, and she has something to say about Vivica's new revelations. On the comment section of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Shade Room's</a>&nbsp;Instagram post about the VladTV interview, she sarcastically wrote, "Awwww" alongside a smiley face and a violin emoji.</p><p>Vivica A. Fox wasn't going to sit back and let this one go though, because as it turns out, the Shade Room's post only showed a clip of the interview and not Fox's whole thought. Fox released the rest of the clip where she goes on to say, "But can I tell you that I’m glad that that’s so over. He now has a girlfriend that’s beautiful. That’s hot and I’m happy for him. I hope he puts a ring on her finger and they live happily ever after. I don’t wish him any ill will…It’s a love-hate situation. But at the core of it all is love. I have respect for him and deep down in his heart I know he has respect for me too because he sees me doing my thing too. But don’t come over here trying to talk no s--t because we all know what’s gon’ happen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Surprised By 50 Cent's 'Mature Response' To Vivica A.
