The Definitive pop culture encyclopedia TV Tropes defined "Word Of God" as follows:</p><p>"A statement regarding some ambiguous or undefined aspect of a work, the Word of God comes from someone considered to be the ultimate authority, such as the creator, director or producer. Such edicts can even go against events as [they] were broadcast, due to someone making a mistake."</p><p>Moreover, the cast of Joker: Folie à Deux has confirmed that Sophie will return, another detail to silence skeptics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It will be interesting to see how her character's arc unfolds given Fleck's attraction to her — and equally interesting to learn whether his equally unstable and violent girlfriend Harley Quinn will tolerate her or not.</p><p>Alas, we won't find out until October 4th rolls around.

this.</p><p>Most people know <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the greatest female singers of the modern era</a>, but she is equally good as an actress.</p><p>Lady Gaga first acted in her music videos, but her star turn in Ryan Murphy's American Horror Story changed audience perceptions of her abilities in an instant.</p><p>People began to see her as a talented

ceremonies.</p><p>Amid the Joker 2 cast, Lady Gaga has taken on a new challenge (similar to Joaquin Phoenix), as audiences adored <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a>'s Harley Quinn.</p><p>Fans are eagerly waiting to witness her Harley to compare her performance to Robbie's, much like Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is still measured up against Heath Ledger's portrayal of the character.</p><p>Will the thirteen-time Grammy Winner pass this fan-administered test?</p><p>If she does, then the movie will almost certainly be a blockbuster — Gaga could very well be the deciding factor in the success of Joker 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to predict with certainty, but Lady

as the notoriously hard-to-win critics' stamps of approval.</p><p>Due to her successful music and acting careers and immense talent, Lady Gaga's net worth is an outstanding estimated $320 million, and
