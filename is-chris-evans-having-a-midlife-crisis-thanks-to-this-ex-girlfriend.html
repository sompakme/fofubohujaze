However, he's single in 2022 might be because of a midlife crisis brought to him by his ex-girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who is Chris Evan's ex-girlfriend, and how did they meet? Does Chris Evans want a family, or is he good at being single forever? Is Chris Evans going back to the dating game after a long hiatus? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=when-did-jenny-slate-and-chris-evans-date>When Did Jenny Slate And Chris Evans Date?</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Evans has dated several ladies, many of whom fans consider rich</a>. His most recent and most controversial ex-girlfriend, Jenny Slate, has a net worth of $6 million as she is a well-decorated actress, comedian, and author. Although it doesn't compare to Chris Evans' whopping $80 million net worth, Kenny might have left a more significant mark on the Captain America actor that is more than just money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris and Jenny started dating in mid-2016</a> as they filmed The Gifted, a film in which they worked as co-stars. Many fans didn't expect a relationship to bloom between the two actors as they didn't leave any clues for the media to speculate anything romantic was going on between them. Their low-key romance became an instant topic online as social media popularly calls Chris Evans 'Everyone's boyfriend.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look Into Chris Evans' Acting Career Outside Marvel</a></span></p><p>However, they quickly ended after almost a year of dating in 2017. Although it's common for the retired <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> actor to have short-term relationships, many fans believe his relationship with Jenny impacted him differently. As he realized how even his significant other couldn't unsee the actor Chris Evans from the regular Chris Evans, it became more difficult for him to find a life-long partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-chris-evans-propose-to-jenny-slate>Did Chris Evans Propose To Jenny Slate?</h2><p>As Chris and Jenny broke up after a short period, Chris did not have enough time even to consider proposing to Jenny Slate between 2016 and 2017. It was also when the Marvel movies he was in became blockbuster hits, so it was challenging for him to balance his career and love life.</p><p>In an interview Jenny Slate had with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>, she opened up about how it felt being in a relationship with Chris Evans. She says, "Chris Evans is a very, very famous person. To be quite honest, I [Jenny Slate] didn't think I was his type. Eventually, when it was like, 'Oh, you have these feelings for me?', 'Is this a prank?' I understand why I think I'm beautiful, but if you've had a certain [Hollywood] lifestyle and I'm a very, very different type of person. I don't want to be an experiment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-jenny-slate-and-chris-evans-still-friends>Are Jenny Slate and Chris Evans Still Friends?</h2><p>In her honest interview with Vulture, Jenny Slate adds, "We're [Chris Evans and Jenny Slate] not on bad terms, but we haven't seen each other, spoken a lot. I think it's probably best. I'd love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though. Ever." It also seems to be the trend for Chris Evan's other rumored girlfriends, such as Kate Bosworth, who has also said nothing but positive comments about Chris as a co-worker.</p><p>After Jenny Slate and Chris Evans broke up in February 2017, Jenny met her current husband, Ben Shattuck. Meanwhile, Chris focused on promoting his and his ex-girlfriend's film, Gifted, which won the hearts of film enthusiasts because of Chris Evans' dramatic role in the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Evans Shockingly Made 200X The Amount Of Tim Allen For His Portrayal Of Buzz Lightyear</a></span></p><p>Chris Evans didn't get involved in another serious relationship and was only rumored to numerous other female celebrities over the recent years. However, as he entered the midlife age, fans were surprised to see how Chris Evans now became more vocal about his wants in a relationship and significant other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Evans Would Return To His Old Superhero Role, But Not The One You Think</a></span></p><p>Moving on from his dating and short-term relationship phase, fans believe Chris' change of relationship preference should also be credited to the realization brought by dating Jenny Slate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-chris-evans-looking-for-a-wife>Is Chris Evans Looking For A Wife?</h2><p>Over the past decades, Chris Evans has been linked to numerous <a href=#>A-list Hollywood celebrities, including Shakira</a>. Still, he never took the rumors seriously and usually just played with them. However, following what fans think is Chris Evans having a midlife crisis in love, he tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shondaland</a> that he is "laser-focused on finding a life partner." Fans then began interpreting 'life partner' as a wife, assuming that Chris is not looking to settle in permanently with a significant other soon.</p><p>Although Chris wants to find a wife and get married finally does not confirm that he is going through a midlife crisis, fans speculate that his past relationship with Jenny and other short-term flings significantly contributed to his preference for a long-term partner in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqmwsCnqmafmae5p77InqWdZZqau6%2FFjKyjmqyVYrqqsMuinZ5lk6e2tLXSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-pronounce-saga.html><span>←</span><span>How to pronounce saga</span></a>
