And Scooter, it ain’t going to be no ‘I’m still putting my name on that sh*t’. I need to get rid of G.O.O.D Music ‘cause I’m great and guess what? Good is the enemy of great.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yeezy then turned his attention to the infamous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wyoming recording sessions</a> and the artists that he worked with. “What the f**k I’m doing giving ‘Wanna Love You’ to f**king Teyana?” he asked in reference to her popular 2018 record “Gonna Love Me.” West asked the same question about King Push and his Grammy-nominated 2018 LP <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daytona</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">West was livid that he gave away what he believes to be the equivalent of three comparable albums to his 2010 classic, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. He then turned his attention to Nas, saying “’Cop Shot The Kid,’ Nas rapping all god damn off-beat on it. Don’t even wanna shoot a video then shoot the video and don’t even tell me. These motherf**kers don’t appreciate me. All these motherf**kers tryna use me. I’m the greatest motherf**king artist living and I can do everything!” Check out the video above.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In another video, Ye claims Cardi B is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Illuminati plant</a> and calls her out for not writing her lyrics. “She don’t write her raps. She’s just there to sound as ignorant as possible and then make songs like, ‘F**k them and get some money,” he said. “She has literally replaced&nbsp;Nicki Minaj, purposely they put her there, and now she doesn’t know what to do, and she has no idea what the f**k is going on. She thinks it’s just a blessing from the universe. It ain’t no blessing from the universe.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Bronx superstar responded in a now-deleted tweet, adding a quote tweet with a heart to a clip of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Donda</a> artist praising her during an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jason Lee</a>. “I’ve always believed in her since she was on [Love & Hip Hop],” he said on Hollywood Unlocked.
