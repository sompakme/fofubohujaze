The task proves to be harder than he thought after Charlie’s mom, Laura (<strong>Wendy Crewson</strong>), and his stepdad, Neil (<a href=#><strong>Judge Reinhold</strong></a>), start to think their son’s obsession with Scott being Santa is unhealthy.</p><p>The adorable Charlie, however, comes to his father’s rescue on more than one occasion, and Scott finally embraces his destiny as Santa.</p><p>Allen reprised the role for the 2002 sequel, <a href=#>The Santa Clause 2</a>. In the holiday classic, Santa is challenged to find a wife a.k.a. a Mrs. Claus before Christmas Eve or find himself a new job. Meanwhile, Scott’s son, Charlie, has become a troublemaker at school, which only makes matter worse.</p><p>In 2006, Allen put on his big red coat for the third installment of magical films, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause. This time around, Scott has to fight Jack Frost (<a href=#><strong>Martin Short</strong></a>) to keep the North Pole from becoming a tourist attraction — and stealing his title of Santa.</p><p>The franchise also starred <strong>David Krumholtz</strong> as head elf Bernard, <strong>Spencer Breslin</strong> as No. 2 elf in charge Curtis and a slew of other mystical creatures, including <strong>Aisha Tyler</strong> as Mother Nature and <strong>Art LaFleur</strong> as the Tooth Fairy.</p><p>While some fans thought they’d <a href=#>seen the last of the Colorado native as both Scott and Santa</a>, they were wrong. In January 2022, Disney+ revealed that Allen would reprise his iconic dual role in a limited series by the same name.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“So here we go again … HoHoHo!” <a href=#>the Christmas With the Kranks actor tweeted</a> at the time, confirming his participation in the newest holiday adventure.</p><p>Scroll down for everything we know about the new Santa Clauses series:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ50pqlrZldmLmiwdKeZKydop6ytHnWoZitZaeaeqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuwMeeZJ2ho6OyunnSoaawZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-monkees-s-she-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>The MonkeessShe Lyrics</span></a>
