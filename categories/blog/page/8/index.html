She asked her parents to get her one, her parents promised to get her one if she started playing tennis. Her father recalled after this bargain, that all little Madison did was try to hit balls into the next yard and her parents did keep their own part of the deal by not only getting her Venus Williams’ type of white tennis dress but also guided her to pursue the career path that they are not only proud of but which she is equally proud of and successful in.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ali Larter Talks 'Varsity Blues,' Reveals If She'll Show Her Kids</h2><time>Sep 23, 2024</time>
