Due to her success, fans love to talk about everything about Swift, including <a href=#>her most popular songs</a>, <a href=#>how she makes money</a>, and <a href=#>her relationship with her parents</a>.</p><p>Of course, one of the other things fans talk about the most is <a href=#>the people that Swift has dated</a> over the years. With that in mind, it makes sense that fans want to know the truth about Swift's relationship with <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>'s family. Swift's connection with some of Travis' family is well documented, but her interactions with his famous brother Jason Kelce are few and far between. This, paired with Jason's January 22nd, 2024 limelight-stealing moment at the Chiefs/Bills game, had really caused fans to wonder if there's a rift between the two...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-fans-think-taylor-swift-and-jason-kelce-don-39-t-like-each-other>Why Fans Think Taylor Swift And Jason Kelce Don't Like Each Other</h2><p>In January 2024, Life and Style published an article about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship. According to that piece, the couple had their first major fight after Travis Kelce was in a funk following a loss and Swift had trouble contending with that. Later in the piece, Life and Style's John Quinn wrote about Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce's brother Jason and his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-mtv-award.jpg><p>According to Life and Style's article, Swift was receiving a frosty reception from Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce. Citing an insider, the article claimed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce haven't been welcoming to Swift</a>.</p><p>“Taylor hasn’t had the best reception from Jason and his wife.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than that, Life and Style's article goes on to state a possible reason why Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce don't like Swift. According to the insider who spoke to the magazine, Swift's friends believe that Jason and Kylie Kelce are jealous.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)">The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan...</p><p>"The source says Taylor’s friends think Jason and Kylie are jealous of Taylor and how much attention she and the 6-foot-5 athlete are receiving.

Instead, there are other reasons why fans have concluded the pop star doesn't like Travis Kelce's brother and sister-in-law.</p><p>In November 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People published an article based on an interview that Kylie Kelce gave</a>. The title of that article has reportedly led to a lot of gossip and rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_why-fans-are-speculating-that-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-will-announce-they-re-having-a-baby_bk_a1_v4.jpg><p>"Kylie Kelce Says It's 'Not My Cup of Tea' to Be in the Spotlight as Kelce Family Fame Soars"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Life and Style's aforementioned article about Swift's relationship with The Kelces, that headline was a big deal. In fact, the publication claims that Swift took that headline very personally and it caused a major rift.</p><p>"Taylor took that personally and since then it’s been very awkward."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-teeth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile">Taylor Swift Fixed Her Teeth, But Fans Are Worried Over Her Smile</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's smile might have been helped out with veneers, but there's another reason fans are concerned about her teeth.</p><p>In light of all these explosive claims about Swift and The Kelces, there has been intense interest in when the pop star will be around her boyfriend's brother. In fact, on January 18th, 2024, The Daily Mail published an article about Swift and Jason Kelce meeting. That article contended that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the meeting was likely to be very awkward</a>.</p><p>"But he and wife Kylie, if she decides to attend as well, could face an awkward reunion with Travis' girlfriend Taylor Swift. That's because in a bombshell report from Life and Style magazine last week, it was claimed Swift doesn't have the warmest relationship with Jason and Kylie. Jason and Kylie have apparently not made the singer feel too welcome and comments made to the media about their relationship have upset Swift."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-very-likely-isn-39-t-feuding-with-jason-kelce-and-kylie-kelce>Taylor Swift Very Likely Isn't Feuding With Jason Kelce And Kylie Kelce</h2><p>From the outside looking in, there is no way to know for sure how Travis Kelce's family feels about Taylor Swift. After all, even if everyone in Travis Kelce's family talked constantly about how much they love Swift, they could be putting up a public front. On top of that, Jason Kelce could seem to like Swift one day and then call her out publicly the next for all anyone knows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/do-taylor-swift-s-cats-live-a-more-pampered-lifestyle-than-travis-kelce_-front-deposit-back-taylor-swift_ig.jpg><p>That said, based on the information that is publicly available as of late January 2024, it seems like talk about the drama is overstated. Of course, that isn't surprising in the least, as most gossip surrounding Swift becomes overly dramatic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first reason to question if the rumors about Swift and Jason Kelce are overstated is that some of them are based on an inside source.</p><p>In many cases, inside sources have a lot of value when publishers carefully investigate those sources and their claims. In fact, inside sources have often played a key role in keeping the public informed.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:19</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-is-drastically-different-from-her-past-famous-romances-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances">Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There are a lot of unique things about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's fascinating relationship.</p><p>On the other hand, the truth is that many publications don't do enough to investigate inside sources and their claims. This is especially true when an inside source is willing to make claims that will help publishers get clicks or sell issues.</p><p>Since gossip about Taylor Swift is a multi-million-dollar industry, it makes sense to question any inside source that talks about her. After all, inside sources have made dramatic claims about every relationship Swift has even been in.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the timeline of Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce's relationship</a>, according to Who's Dating Who?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Started dating in 2013</strong></li><li><strong>Got married on April 14th, 2018</strong></li><li><strong>Had a child on October 2nd, 2019</strong></li><li><strong>Had a second child on March 5th, 2021</strong></li><li><strong>Had a third child on February 24th, 2023</strong></li></ul><p>More importantly, there is a specific claim that has been made about Swift and Kylie Kelce that shouldn't be taken at face value. According to reports, Swift was deeply offended by comments Kylie Kelce made during an interview. That report is very difficult to believe if you look closer into the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jason-kelce-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On November 19th, 2023, Kylie Kelce gave an interview to Spectrum News Kansas City about a sports program she was working on for girls. During that interview, Kylie Kelce was asked about her family being under the spotlight thanks to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship. Kylie Kelce's response was clickbaited into a dig at Swift, but when read in full, it seems clear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was only talking about herself</a>.</p><p>"It’s not particularly my cup of tea to be in the spotlight or in front of a camera. I was a communication major in college. I love to be behind it. That's my bread and butter."</p><p>Even if people still want to construe that response as a shot at Swift, Kylie Kelce later denied that is what she was doing. In a TikTok, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Kelce called out People's aforementioned headline</a> that made it seem like she was calling out Swift. Furthermore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Kelce later posted a video of her daughter set to Swift's song "Never Grow Up"</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-kelce-stole-the-spotlight-from-taylor-swift>Jason Kelce Stole The Spotlight From Taylor Swift</h2><p>On January 21st, 2024, Taylor Swift, Kylie Kelce, and Jason Kelce all attended a Chiefs game against the Bulls. As the aforementioned article from The Daily Mail suggested, members of the media felt like things could get very awkward at that game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-awards-2022.jpg><p>While there were a lot of predictions about what might happen when Swift was in the same area as the Kelces, nobody called what went down. For the first time in a very long time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift wound up being completely upstaged</a> by Jason Kelce.</p><p>Since Swift has been attending Travis Kelce's games, the cameras seem to find her, so they can capture her reactions to everything. By the end of the night on January 21st, 2024, however, all eyes were on Jason Kelce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason for that is by the end of the night, a shirtless Jason Kelce could be seen celebrating his brother's success. Most notably, an elated Jason Kelce jumped out of the VIP box as he celebrated after his brother scored a touchdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-noticed-an-icy-rift-between-travis-kelce-s-brother-jason-and-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship_-front-right-_deposit-left-instar.jpg><p>As for any belief that Jason Kelce has a grudge against Taylor Swift, the chances of that seemed very small after a video from the event emerged.</p><p>As a shirtless Jason Kelce made his way among the fans in attendance, he spotted a young girl holding a sign dedicated to Swift. Jason Kelce then took the girl in front of the VIP box where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he held her up, so she could show her sign to Swift</a>. Jason Kelce could be heard explaining to the girl, "We're going to show this to Taylor, alright?" To say that most fans were charmed by this moment is an understatement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp6rXZe%2FsMDHnqlmopGovK9505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2bsrawjJ%2BYp2Wimq6kwM6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-shab-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Shab Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
