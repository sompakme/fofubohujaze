If his estimates are correct, this also means that Grande is the highest-paid coach on the NBC program thus far.</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Wrap</a>, Shelton and former coach Adam Levine received $13 million when they first joined The Voice years ago. By the time that the Maroon 5 frontman left the show, he was already making $14 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Net Worth Of Every Coach From The Voice, Past And Present</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shelton’s fiancée, Gwen Stefani, received $1 million during the first season of The Voice.
