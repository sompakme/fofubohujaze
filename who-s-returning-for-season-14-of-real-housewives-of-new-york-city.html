Episodes during the season didn't even hit a million views as opposed to the past seasons raking in over a million. The season didn't even have a reunion, something that has never happened in the history of <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives</strong></a>. So who will be returning to spice up season 14 and make sure viewers are happy with the newest season?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-ramona-singer-and-luann-de-lesseps-returning>Are Ramona Singer And Luann De Lesseps Returning?</h2><p>While Bravo has denied these specific casting rumors, housewife friend David Yontef has revealed why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it is quite possible that Ramona and Luann are the only two returning</a> for season 14.</p><p>Ramona and Luann are OG housewives, starring in the very first season of the franchise. They are loved by fans and seeing them in the new season will be a big hit.</p><p>The two are close but definitely have their drama, making them a perfect return for the newest season. They recently appeared together on The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ramona Singer Leaves Shady Comment On Countess Luann's Newest Photo</a></span></p><p>What's shocking is that Sonja Morgan, Ramona and Luann's dear friend, might not be returning. Sonja is a huge personality that adds a lot to the show. It is unclear why she would not be returning for season 14.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another theory suggests Tinsley Mortimer might be returning alongside Ramona and Luann. <a href=#>Mortimer left the show in the middle of season 12</a> to move to Chicago with boyfriend Scott Kluth and eventually get married.</p><p>Since her breakup with Scott, it seems she would be a great fit for the season since she is close with both Ramona and Luann.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=who-will-not-be-returning>Who Will Not Be Returning?</h2><p><a href=#>Leah McSweeney was a controversial castmate</a> when she first appeared on season 12. She only knew Tinsley and was close to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was getting to know the group who were quite judgemental of her. Her main drama was with Ramona Singer. Leah was judged for her tattoos, not living on the Upper East Side like the rest of the girls, and talking openly about intimate matters.</p><p>In season 13 Leah became close with the newest castmate, Eboni K. Williams. They spent time together off of the show solidifying that their relationship was not just for the cameras. This season was quite different from previous ones for cast-mates like Ramona and Luann because hard questions were asked regarding race and current politics in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leah and Sonja were always open to hearing what Eboni had to say, but the two OG housewives pushed back a lot towards Williams. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eboni even took a break from social media</a> saying, "Tonight’s episode and next week’s episode are really intense and really important … and I want you to lean into them and I want you to watch them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things To Know About 'RHONY' Newbie, Eboni K. Williams</a></span></p><p>She went on to stress the uniqueness of the show’s current season amid the pandemic and the ongoing “dynamic call to action around racial reconciliation.”</p><h2 id=cast-mates-from-previous-seasons-that-fans-want-to-see-back>Cast-Mates From Previous Seasons That Fans Want To See Back</h2><p>Bethenny Frankel is a beloved OG housewife. Fans have seen her go through every major life event on the show. She even had her own spin-off show that depicted her life during her marriage, which resulted in a difficult divorce for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is safe to say fans would love to see her back on the show, but it may not be a possibility.</p><p>Bethenny wants real authenticity from the show if she were to come back. She also said she misses the humor. Frankel always made fans laugh during her confessionals. Bethenny is doing well on her own without the show hosting her own podcast, running her Skinny Girl brand, and of course spending time with her daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Bethenny Frankel Never Put Her Daughter Bryn on 'RHONY'</a></span></p><p>Jill Zarin is another OG housewife that fans would want to see back on the show. Zarin and Frankel shared an extremely close friendship during their time on the show. They had a major fallout, and it was a huge storyline that viewers were hooked on. Due to the drama, <a href=#>Zarin left the show season four</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zarin will appear on Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season two with Dorinda Medley, a previous RHONY cast-mate. It is unclear who will actually return for season 14 of RHONY until Bravo confirms it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'RHONY' Star Sonja Morgan Is Surprisingly Broke, Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur86moKefXZeupLeMnJisrF2osqK%2Fzqdkamxdp7WvxcJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-re-channeling-dakota-johnson-s-4-800-shearling-coat-look.html><span>←</span><span>Were Channeling Dakota Johnsons $4,800 Shearling Coat Look</span></a>
