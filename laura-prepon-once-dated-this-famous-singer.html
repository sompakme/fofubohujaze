These days, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">40-year-old Laura is happily settled down</a> with her man and two kids. But that doesn't mean fans don't love rehashing her past relationships and all the drama surrounding them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one, there were rumors that Laura and her co-star Topher Grace were even closer than they appeared on-screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Laura Prepon And Topher Grace's Rumored Hookup</a></span></p><p>To be fair, Laura isn't the only one with rumors circling about her former relationships. Topher, for one, dated plenty of eligible Hollywood bachelorettes in his early days of sitcom fame.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Canada</a> says he had relationships (albeit brief in some cases) with Anne Hathaway (they were in a rom-com together, and sources say they connected off-screen too), Ginnifer Goodwin,&nbsp; and Emmy Rossum.</p><p>And the list of ladies Wilmer Valderrama wooed is even longer!</p><p>But it's true that Laura did date a handful of guys while she was starring on 'That '70s Show,' and plenty of them were familiar faces in Hollywood, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Prepon Used To Date This 'That '70s Show' Co-Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After she split from a former co-star from 'That '70s Show,' notes&nbsp;ET Canada, Laura dated Anthony Kiedis. Now, fans who aren't also super into music may not recognize the name without any context. For reference, Kiedis is the frontman of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p>And this one isn't a rumored relationship; it appears to have been confirmed. In fact, in 2008, the couple stepped out at UFC 86 in Las Vegas and were snapped by paparazzi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/anthony-kiedis-laura-prepon-ufc-las-vegas.jpg><p>Though Laura's probably the better recognized of the two of them, Kiedis has his own fan following (and for good reason!) that likes to track his past relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AnthonyKiedis.net</a> highlights as many of Kiedis' past relationships as possible in an ex-girlfriends gallery. The exes he's been photographed with include Heidi Klum, Celesta Hodge, and Laura Freedman. But the site specifies that Anthony has also dated Sofia Coppola, Jessica Stam, Ione Skye, and Helena Vestergaard.</p><p>Anthony Kiedis doesn't seem to have settled down yet (though he does have a son with ex Heather Christie), in stark contrast to ex Laura's wedded and domestic bliss these days. But whatever brought the two together, fans were all over their brief romance.</p><p>Sadly, it didn't appear to last long. And though&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura has changed a lot since her days on 'That '70s Show,'</a>&nbsp;clearly, past relationships have aided that growth. As for Anthony, he probably isn't pining after Laura these days, but fans have to wonder, did he ever write a song about her?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Anthony Kiedis Spends His Red Hot $140 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddoa62vsBmp6udoKS7brDArZydZZaWurDB0maqoqaXmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-tried-it-botox-to-treat-teeth-grinding.html><span>←</span><span>I Tried It: Botox to Treat Teeth Grinding</span></a>
