That little red tab and brown leather stamp stitched above the right back pocket are the telltale signs that a cool outfit is approaching. When you throw on a pair of classic Levi’s blue jeans, you’re rocking a totally timeless and authentic look.</p><p>But sometimes blue jeans aren’t the vibe; you’d rather opt for a nice, versatile pair of black jeans. A pair of black jeans is essential for any wardrobe, especially at this time of year when skirts and shorts aren’t the best options. If you’re on the lookout for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">new pair</a>, Levi’s might be your first instinct, but it can be hard to find the right ones with a proper fit and style.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Levi’s Ribcage Straight Ankle Jeans</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$50</a> (originally $80) at Amazon!

These black ankle jeans are Levi’s highest high-rise jeans yet — they reach 12 inches above the top of your thigh, visually slimming your legs while shaping your waist.</p><p>The denim is made of a cotton and elastane blend, so these jeans are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ultra-soft </a>and stretchy. There are five pockets to store all of your essentials, perfect for those occasions when you don’t want to bring a purse but still want to be able to bring your phone, credit card and lip balm. These are the perfect pants for a day out on the town or out to dinner with the girls.</p><p>And it doesn’t matter if it’s the middle of February or the middle of September; you can style these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denim legends</a> however you please, all year round! The styling possibilities are truly endless. For the wintertime, we’re loving the look of these jeans layered with a turtleneck sweater tucked in, a cardigan, a trench coat and leather boots. So chic!</p><p>If you’re looking for a blank canvas to enrich with your unique flair, all you need is a white shirt and a pair of sneakers. Yep — that’s all! Reviewers <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">are obsessed </a>with the flattering and comforting fit as well as the versatility for daily wear.
