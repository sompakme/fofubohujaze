While everyone knows and loves him as the friendly and funny host of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, along with <a href=#>many other food competition shows</a>, Fieri had some hard experiences that he doesn't talk about as much. Fans should know about these sad moments in Guy Fieri's life.</p><h2 id=why-did-guy-fieri-39-s-sister-morgan-die>Why Did Guy Fieri's Sister Morgan Die?</h2><p>Part of what fans like so much about Guy Fieri is how chatty he is. While he has a reputation for making corny jokes and not everyone loves that he calls himself The Mayor of Flavortown, his great TV presence can't be denied.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guy-fieri-s-sister-morgan-s-death-isn-t-the-only-heartbreaking-tragedy-the-food-network-star-has-experienced.jpg><p>While Fieri is a fun-loving TV host, his life hasn't been entirely without pain and suffering. He had to grieve the death of his sibling.</p><p>In 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri's sister Morgan died</a> due to metastatic melanoma. She was 38 years old. Fieri's fans know how much he loves his family: his wife Lori and his sons Ryder and Hunter. Fans of the Food Network are used to seeing Guy and Hunter on TV together as Hunter often appears on a lot of his dad's TV shows. Fieri has talked about his sister on social media sometimes, and it's clear that he misses her so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guy-fieri.jpg><p>According to People, Fieri talked about how even though of course he and his parents still get emotional when they think about his sibling, his mom and dad showed him that it's possible to be positive despite feeling so much grief.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Guy Fieri's Net Worth Exploded During The Pandemic</a></span></p><p>Fieri talked to People about Morgan and said that he realized that he has to be grateful for the present moment. He said, "I lost my little sister 12 years ago to cancer. My dad just beat pancreatic cancer five years ago, which was a miracle. And he's been a great advocate for people that have gone through it. I think you got to live every single day. That's the biggest thing — is you never know what tomorrow's going to bring. And that's one of the reasons I live the way I live. I'm not going to waste today."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guy-fieri-1.jpg><p>According to Mashed, Fieri became interested in vegetarian meals because his sister Morgan ate that way. He explained, "My sister was a great cook. She was always introducing me to new ways to cook with vegetables, going, 'try this' or 'try that.' She got me to be more creative with my vegetarian cooking, and now I'm much more veggie-centric on my plate."</p><h2 id=guy-fieri-was-in-a-car-accident-and-was-thrown-off-a-horse-as-a-child>Guy Fieri Was In A Car Accident And Was Thrown Off A Horse As A Child</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri talked about a terrible car crash</a> that he was part of as a university student on the podcast Now What? with Brooke Shields.</p><p>According to The New York Post, Fieri explained, “I was in a fatality car accident when I was 19 when I was in college. I wasn’t driving, I was in the backseat. And unfortunately, I was with a bunch of guys and … we were drinking.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Restaurants Does Food Network Star Guy Fieri Own?</a></span></p><p>Fieri said that the police came to his dorm and said that he was under arrest. The people that he was around told the cops that he was the one behind the wheel, which is why they were paying attention to him. This wasn't the case, though. He explained that someone in his car passed away after the accident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guy-fieri-3.jpg><p>As Fieri explained on the podcast, he made sure to tell his children that they should be careful about what they are drinking and they shouldn't get into a car with just anyone. He also said that when he told his father what happened, his father was understandably really upset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fieri realized that he had to be careful and make sure that he could get through college and make something of himself.</p><p>While the accident wasn't Fieri's fault, it sounds like it definitely scared him. It must have been unbelievably terrifying for him to experience this at such a young age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Guy Fieri’s Wife Really Thinks About His Greasy Diet</a></span></p><p>This wasn't the only tough moment in Guy Fieri's life. When he was interviewed by GQ, he explained that he went on a horse when he was only 10 and had a terrifying experience.</p><p>After Fieri was thrown off the horse, the animal jumped on him. Fieri's heart was sore and he lost part of his liver. It's even worse to hear that he needed to get surgery and his mom and dad weren't even in town because they were on a European vacation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guy-fieri-2.jpg><p>The reality TV host and restaurant owner has only shared a little bit about these terrible experiences. Most of the time, he focuses on his food career and talks about what he has achieved.</p><p>In an interview for The Robert Irvine Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri explained his viewpoint on his career</a> and how he is able to keep working hard, year after year.</p><p>He said, "Then remember nothing is free. Nothing I’ve ever seen worth having is for free. Everything takes time, energy, effort, respect, love. It takes all of that. It’s like doing television. It’s like doing the restaurant business. It’s tough work, but if you really love it, 12-hour days aren’t as bad. If it’s something you didn’t love, 12-hour days would be impossible. But what a lot of people do is they chase somebody else’s version of success. They keep up with the Joneses."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-Times-Guy-Fieri-Was-The-GOAT_-and-2-Times-He-Messed-Up.jpg><p>Guy Fieri definitely likes having a lot going on. As he told Variety in 2022, "I have about 90 restaurants right now, the shows, two boys, 500 goats, a bunch of cars, a bunch of projects, a bunch of hobbies. I’m building a blacksmith shop and a leather shop right now. Every day is work, and every day is life. I’m also a little ADD — if I have 90 things going on, I feel a lot better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGierrFdm7amvshmqqKrpJq%2FbrnOq56apl2ZsqLAx2arq5mXmrGqsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./baby-boom-15-largest-litters-in-human-history.html><span>←</span><span>Baby Boom: 15 Largest Litters In Human History</span></a>
