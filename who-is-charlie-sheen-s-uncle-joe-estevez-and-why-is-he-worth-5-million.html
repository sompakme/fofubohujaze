Each member of the family has contributed something to the world of Hollywood and filmmaking and the family even has their own production company. <a href=#>Martin Sheen</a> is an iconic name thanks to his performance in the film Apocalypse Now, widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, and he has since worked with other Hollywood legends like Aaron Sorkin or Martin Scorsese. Sheen’s sons Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen have each made names for themselves acting in box-office hits and popular TV shows, and the rest of the Estevez/Sheen clan do okay for themselves as writers, actors, producers, and directors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Are Charlie Sheen's Relatives Worth?</a></span></p><p>But one outlier of the family brand is Martin’s younger brother, Joe. Joe Estevez is Martin Sheen’s only brother and sibling and is Charlie and Emilio’s only uncle. His voice and appearance make him a dead ringer for his brother, and were it not for a mustache which Joe occasionally shaves off for his acting roles, one could hardly tell the two men apart. While Martin Sheen became famous thanks to his work on high-class projects like The West Wing, The Departed, and of course Apocalypse Now, his brother Joe found a different path working regularly on television and in schlocky B-movies. It paid off though, because Charlie Sheen’s uncle Joe can claim a net worth of $5 million.</p><h2 id=his-work-on-39-apocalypse-now-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Work On 'Apocalypse Now'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Estevez is without a doubt still collecting residuals from this film, although they are probably meager compared to his brother's. However, Estevez was still instrumental in helping complete the production of the movie, which film buffs will tell you was one of the worst debacles in Hollywood history second only to the production of Jaws or The Island of Dr. Maurau. But Estevez, being a dead ringer for his brother, helped complete the film. The film features voice over narration from it’s main character Captain Benjamin Willard, which was provided by Estevez because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Sheen was suffering from health issues at the time</a>. Joe also stood in for Martin on a few long shots.</p><h2 id=made-for-tv-movies><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Made-For-TV Movies</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe Estevez found consistent work on television in the 1970s and 1980s. His first role was as the bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd in a made-for-TV biopic in 1974. He also played Troy Hatfield in another made-for-TV historical drama, The Hatfields and The Macoys in 1975. He has also been in a CBS Schoolbreak Special and had bit roles in The Invisible Woman and I Married A Centerfold.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is John Waters, The King Of Camp, Worth Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=bit-roles-in-tv-shows><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bit Roles In TV Shows</span></h2><p>Along with several other television movies, Joe Estevez can also be seen in episodes of CHiPs, The Brady Brides, Whiz Kids and Starman. His name is somewhat hard to track because he did not permanently adopt the use of Joe Estevez as his stage name until later in his career. Several of his television roles are credited to different stage names, like Joseph Estevez, Joseph Sheen, Joe Sheen, or Joseph Phelan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-he-is-a-legendary-b-movie-actor><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why He Is A Legendary B-Movie Actor</span></h2><p>Estevez found consistent work in the underground and B-movie world and his resume is extraordinarily extensive in this department, comparable to that of <a href=#>other B-movie icons like Bruce Campbell.</a> Titles under his name include Soultaker (1990) Werewolf (1996) and Samurai Cop 2 (2015) He also acted opposite other B-movie legends, like the giant chinned Robert Z’Dar. Many of his films are straight-to-video releases.</p><h2 id=39-mystery-science-theater-3000-39-helped-him-become-a-b-movie-legend><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Mystery Science Theater 3000' Helped Him Become A B-Movie Legend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Estevez’s films, like most cult B-movies, are lampooned regularly on movie riffing shows, websites, and Youtube channels. Two of the films mentioned above, Soultaker and Werewolf, have become <a href=#>popular episodes of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 </a>and the website Rifftrax, which is hosted by alumni of Mystery Science Theater 3000, has riffed several of his films including Roller Gator and Baby Ghost.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Joel Hodgson Saved His Show 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-makes-frequent-appearances-on-adult-swim-shows><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Makes Frequent Appearances On Adult Swim Shows</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of Estevez’s more current television work has been on Adult Swim shows where he either plays himself or parodies his B-movie persona. He was in an episode of Chris Elliot’s Adult Swim Show EagleHeart in 2013 as himself and Tim Heidecker of the Tim and Eric duo casts Joe regularly. Estevez plays himself on Heidecker’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Cinema </a>series, and he plays President Jason Davidson on his action espionage lampoon Decker. He was also called in as a character witness for Tim Heidecker’s “trial” in 2015.</p><h2 id=his-imdb-credit-total-closely-competes-with-his-brother-martin-rsquo-s><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His IMDb Credit Total Closely Competes With His Brother Martin’s</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, Joe Estevez has over 300 acting credits to his name, which is more than his brother Martin, who has only 261 acting credits. However Martin’s roles were more iconic, and he has 300 credits as "playing himself" while Joe has a measly 30. In any case, it would seem that Joe found a way to make a healthy living for himself and has worked as consistently as his brother, just amongst a different type of audience than West Wing fans. Thanks to his work on Apocalypse Now and his long list of projects on IMDb, he has accumulated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a respectable net worth of $5 million</a>. While he might not be the richest member of the Sheen dynasty, he is not their poorest, and he has always worked as consistently as Martin.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Elvira 'Mistress Of The Dark' Gained Her $3 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8eaqaWhlWLAqbHEp2SuppOhsm62zp5knqukmsOmxoywn7Jlp6S%2FtbSMbmSmoZyhtrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-adam-klei-kennewick-shooting-suspect.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Adam Klei, Kennewick shooting suspect?</span></a>
