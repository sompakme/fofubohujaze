You’ve been drinking more than I have recently,” Jason said before shutting down Travis’ claims that he hasn’t “stayed out past 10 p.m.” since 2017.</p><p class=p1>Jason added, “Did you not see me at your playoff games this year? No, [I don’t remember] because I was drinking all day. … I think drinking games, I will destroy him because I got the mental advantage, [but] beer pong, I’m not beating him in.”</p><p class=p1>Jason’s NFL season, his last before hanging up his football cleats for good, <a href=#>ended in January</a> during the playoffs. Since then, he and wife <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong> continued to step out <a href=#>at Chiefs playoff games</a> that took the team all the way to the Super Bowl. The Chiefs ultimately won the championship in February, which Jason, Kylie and Travis’ girlfriend, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, watched <a href=#>from a private suite</a> with the brothers’ parents, <strong>Donna</strong> and <strong>Ed Kelce</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Since wrapping up the NFL season, Travis has been <a href=#>recuperating and spending time with Swift</a>, 34.
