After her detox diet and primarily eating vegetables, Hathaway was able to cut out the weight and maintain that weight loss by eating almost nothing besides oatmeal during filming.

To get into this mindset he stopped eating and when he felt hungry he knew he was in the right mindset for the role.

As 50 Cent was driven to make sure that he fit the part, he didn’t go to a doctor and reviewed himself in the mirror thinking he needed to lose more weight. This was regardless of the director's request that he consult a physician. He is back to his normal weight now.</p><h2 id=lily-collins>Lily Collins</h2><p><a href=#>Lily Collins</a> used her strengths to portray a character she felt was important and needed to be as accurate as possible. She played a girl with anorexia in the film called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>To The Bone</i></a> and showed the dangers of anorexia. She struggled with anorexia personally and lost weight to portray her character. Anorexia is essentially eating nothing and obsessing over the possibility of weight gain. Lily Collins was scared to play the role, but felt that is was safer with a nutritionist and many people supporting her goals. She felt the strain of anorexia while filming but was consistently supported by her mother.</p><h2 id=natalie-portman>Natalie Portman</h2><p><i></i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>Black Swan</i> is a movie about ballerinas, and Natalie Portman dropped 20 pounds for the role. This left her at 95 pounds, not very much for the 5-foot 3-inch actress. According to her trainer, she practiced dancing for 16 hours a day <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while only consuming coffee</a> to keep her weight down. This made her look very accurate and the same as the character she was trying to portray, and even her trainer was impressed. In six months she dropped 20 pounds and began to look like a professional ballerina. The&nbsp;lack of food starts to get to you after a while and Natalie Portman said it was the toughest role she'd ever taken.</p><h2 id=zoe-kravitz>Zoe Kravitz</h2><p><a href=#>Zoe Kravitz</a> lost 20 pounds for the movie <i>The Road Within</i>, which doesn't sound like much until you understand she was down to 90 pounds after losing that weight. She was eating vegetables and running every day in order to keep her weight down. She said it was tough because of the constant lightheadedness while trying to act. Having struggled with an eating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disorder</a> in her early 20s, Zoe Kravitz took precautions and knew the risks and strategies to successfully fit this role. Although she related to weight loss in a lot of ways, she says she'd never tell anyone to lose that amount of weight in such a short amount of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-pratt>Chris Pratt</h2><p><i></i></p><p><a href=#><i>Guardians Of The Galaxy</i></a> is a classic sci-fi movie, and little do most people know, Chris Pratt lost nearly 70 pounds in six months for his role in the movie. He preaches that drinking a lot of fluids is the ultimate strategy for losing weight. He says to start with drinking lots of water and don't have any carbs, no beer, no burgers, no onion rings. Also, he says to work out five times a week. He says if you take an hour out of your day and drink water and exercise, you feel better mentally, spiritually, and physically. He exercises 3-4 times a day now and he is still in great shape.</p><h2 id=michelle-pfeiffer>Michelle Pfeiffer</h2><p>Michelle Pfeiffer said she ate only tomato soup during the filming of <i>Scarface </i>in order to continually lose weight throughout the filming of the movie. As the filming got extended further and further the crew ended up sneaking her bagels because they were worried about her. The filming went on for six weeks longer than expected and she had to be at her thinnest for the final scene. She ultimately succeeded and is surprisingly calm about the whole experience. When asked about her weight during the filming of <i>Scarface </i>she simply recounted her story and told the truth of the matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In The World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5np5q2qLTTZphmpZmjwrWxjJycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZJ2qkaKutbXCmqOlsV2WubWx0Z6bZqSfqMFus8CipZ6cXayyqrPHrWSfp6Jiv7C4xGaYnKyZo7RutMCtn5qvka56sbTOnqWisF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90-day-fiance-s-chantel-everett-and-pedro-jimeno-divorce-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>'90 Day Fiance's Chantel Everett and Pedro Jimeno Divorce Timeline</span></a>
