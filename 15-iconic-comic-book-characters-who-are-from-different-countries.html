The only parameters for such a list is that the hero is fairly well known to the general public and that they are from a completely different country than the other heroes on this list.

Hercules: Greece</strong></h2><p>Via gamespot.com</p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">Some of you may not be familiar with the relatively obscure comic book version of the hero Hercules (though he was once a prominent member of the Avengers)</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">, but surely all of you are aware of his inspiration, the hero from Greek mythology. In fact, many of the characters and storylines used in the comics are taken directly from the</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">se</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763"> ancient myths</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">As such, you know that Herc is the son of </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">the</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">almighty</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763"> Zeus, who </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">rules from atop Mount Olympus in Greece. Therefore, the character of Hercules is undeniably Greek himself. He undoubtedly shows some Greek characteristics, especially ancient Greek characteristics</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763">,</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX262404763"> including a love of traditional wrestling and intoxicating wines. His storied Greek lineage makes the powerful Hercules the perfect choice to start off this list at #15.</span></p><h2 id=14-thor-technically-asgard-scandinavian-mythology><strong>14.

Aquaman:&nbsp;Atlantis&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>via dccomics.com</p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">While compiling this list, I tried to think of heroes who were outside the mold of the typical U.S. born heroes. Then it hit me, Aquaman. </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">Though</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231"> the original Justice League member doesn't have a particular nation that he calls home, his </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">domain i</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">s</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231"> any nation which borders on the ocean (sorry Czech Republic). More importantly than that, I really wanted to have a list where I could finally include Aquaman. The brunt of countless superhero jokes (thanks Family Guy), for years Aquaman just hasn't been getting </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">the </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231">respect</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX58313231"> he deserves from the general populace. Hopefully his listing here (combined with <a href=#>Jason Momoa</a>'s badass portrayal in the upcoming Justice League movie) will garner the hero of the oceans some long overdue respect.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-quake-china><strong>12. Quake: China</strong></h2><p>Via forums.marvelheroes.com</p><p>A relatively obscure superhero, Quake has gained some notoriety lately with her inclusion in the successful Marvel's Agents of Shield television series (prior to this she was featured in the Avengers comic). As her name suggests, Quake is able to create powerful vibrations which can, among other things, create earthquakes. Also interesting about Quake, and most importantly for this list, is that she is half ethnically Chinese and was born in China. In the storyline created for the Agents of Shield television show, Quake has to be shipped out of China to avoid being taken by Hydra after her mother's (another super powered person) death. I'm glad that we were able to find a hero born in the far east to add some diversity to this list.</p><h2 id=11-ghost-rider-mexico><strong>11. Ghost Rider: Mexico</strong></h2><p>Via comicbook.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I think perhaps the decision makers for Marvel's movie empires biggest issue in the past was how they were going to use the Ghost Rider character. While the comic is hugely popular, the character and storyline is such that makes it hard to integrate into a superhero bonanza like the Avengers movies.</p><p>One way Marvel has sought to counteract this is to change the identity of the Ghost Rider, and for this article, that important character change occurred when Robbie Reyes became the newest Ghost Rider. Of Mexican-American descent, this incarnation of Ghost Rider is primarily concerned with curbing the violence of hispanic street gangs, the likes of which put his younger brother in a wheelchair. The Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider comics are filled with references to Mexican culture, making him the perfect representative of Mexico to make this list.</p><h2 id=10-judge-dredd-united-kingdom><strong>10. Judge Dredd: United Kingdom</strong></h2><p>Via wallpapercave.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788">So I had to go outside the typical superhero spectrum for this one. Many of you will remember Judge Dredd from the 1995 action movie starring <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a>, however, prior to that, he&nbsp;was a very </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788">successful</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788"> comic book character. What many people do not know about the Judge is that his futuristic storyline is supposed to take place not in the U.S., but in the </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788">United</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788"> Kingdom. This makes sense, if you think about it, as the robotic law and order personality is very reminiscent of the British stereotype (think the Royal Guards of Buckingham Palace) </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788">As such, Judge Dredd is the perfect choice to represent the U.K. on this list, here at #10, though I&nbsp;</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX59194788">do find it strange that if Judge Dredd is supposed to take place in England why do none of the characters have a British accent?</span></p><p>There was another movie made in 2012 that was also about Dredd, this time starring <a href=#>Karl Urban</a> and <a href=#>Lena Headey</a>.</p><h2 id=9-dr-doom-latveria><strong>9. Dr. Doom: Latveria</strong></h2><p>via marvel.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So I'm admittedly breaking my own hero rule here with this one, but since Victor Von Doom, AKA Dr. Doom, is literally the ruler of the fictional kingdom of Latveria, I thought that he warranted an&nbsp;exception. One of the good things about the 2005 Fantastic 4 film was that it was littered with references to Doom's Latverian heritage. For example, it was great for me to see at the end of the film when after he was made into the statue he was unceremoniously shipped off to Latveria in a crate. The Fantastic 4 comics have placed even more importance on Doom's status as Latveria's most infamous citizen, even going so far as to have several of them take place within the small European nation. Doom's status as such a prominent Latvian allows him to escape our supervillain bias and find a spot for him on our list here at #9.</p><h2 id=8-winter-soldier-u-s-s-r><strong>8. Winter Soldier: U.S.S.R.</strong></h2><p>Via ign.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to avoid being bombarded by comments regarding two inductions of Russian characters, I chose to include the Winter Soldier as a representative of the U.S.S.R. as a distinct country from modern Russia. Without giving a full-fledged history lesson, the U.S.S.R., or Soviet Union&nbsp;was a communist collection of territory which included (and was largely composed of) modern Russia. One of the Soviets most well-known innovations was the secret police organization known as the KGB. The Winter Soldier was given his powers (in addition to being brainwashed) by the KGB. Therefore, while the actual person who is the Winter Soldier, Bucky, may be American, the Winter Soldier was very much a creation of the Soviets. Also I just couldn't resist the opportunity to include him behind Cap (who appears below) on one of my lists.</p><h2 id=7-scarlet-witch-transia><strong>7. Scarlet Witch: Transia</strong></h2><p>Via hollywoodreporter.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">Wanda Maximoff, AKA Scarlet Witch, is another hero from our list to come from a fictional country (</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">Transia</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">) but we can so</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">mewh</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">at</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080"> figure out that it's supposed to be located somewhere in eastern Europe. </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">Scarlet Witch was </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">initi</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">ally a simple sorceress, capable of creating "hex-spheres" causing a molecular disturbance. This allowed her to do things such as create extreme heat out of seemingly nothing, or stop the movement of airborne objects (force fields). However, as she aged and her powers increased, she was able to do things to the </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">magnitude</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080"> of </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">creating </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">entire armies out of thin air. More importantly for this list, I think the Scarlet Witch character does a good job going through her storyline, while showing the incredible hardships eastern Europeans have faced (and continue to face) in their </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX234716080">everyday lives. That is enough to place the powerful Scarlet Witch character here on our list at #7.</span></p><h2 id=6-wonder-woman-themyscira><strong>6.

Wonder Woman has been a staple of DC since 1941 and is certainly in the Mount Rushmore of famous superheroes. As it pertains to this list, Wonder Woman is important because she was born and raised in the fictitious </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710">city of Paradise Island. Then, (with various </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710">discrepa</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710">ncies</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710"> between the storylines) a great evil caused her to leave her homeland and become a defender of the human race. Her unique </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710">homeland</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX239194710"> combined with her immense legacy and importance to the DC universe allow Wonder Woman to grace our list here at #6.</span></p><h2 id=5-wolverine-canada><strong>5. Wolverine: Canada</strong></h2><p>Via ign.com</p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">Fans became familiar with the "tough as nails" anti-hero of the X-men in 2000 at the forefront of the superhero movie craze. Since then, the Wolverine character, played by <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a>, has become a staple of the X-men franchise</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">. Jackman's Wolverine has gotten so popular that the X-men movie producers have started writing in minor roles for him into the films just to placate his rabid fan base (see X-men </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">Apoc</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">a</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">lypse</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">). What most people likely don't know about the clawed hero, however, is that he's a Canuck. That's right, the rough and tumble grandfather of the X-men is actually from Canada. In fact, when the Wolverine character made his comic debut, it was in the Incredible Hulk comic where he was recruited by </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">his Canadian government to take down the </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">indes</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">tructi</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318">ble</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCX81145318"> beast. While Wolverine's Canadian heritage isn't well known, it does kind of make sense if you think about it. He's basically a wild animal and a large part of Canada is wilderness, perfectly logical.
