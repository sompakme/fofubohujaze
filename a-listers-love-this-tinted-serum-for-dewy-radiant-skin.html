Well, we found a product that flips the script and has an adoring celebrity fan club itself. What could be so spectacular, you may be wondering? The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint</a> has major A-listers like <strong>Kate Hudson</strong>, <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>, <strong>Miranda Kerr</strong> and <strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong> fan-girling over the “dewy radiant skin” it gives them.</p><p>In <a href=# rel=noopener>an interview</a> with <i>Glamour</i> on her skincare routine, Hudson said the tinted serum makes “a really great tinted SPF 40,” while also giving her “super dewy” finish that she loves. Also a fan of the SPF protection, <a href=# rel=noopener>Crawford said</a>&nbsp;the tint is a staple in her summer beauty routine and loves how it gives her that “little bit” of glow. <a href=# rel=noopener>Hudgens</a> “fell in love” with it for its “all-in-one” formula and calls it her “little hack” for evening out the difference in skin color from her face to her neck. And beyond being a great everyday go-to, Kerr even relied on it for stunningly glowing skin on the Met Gala red carpet in 2022.
