The Truth About Jeremy's Mysterious Rel</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There's no sugarcoating the fact that <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a></strong> and his father, Jeremy Bieber, have had a difficult relationship over the years. But what is Jeremy’s relationship like with his daughter-in-law, Hailey Bieber?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bond between a son and his father isn’t always natural and successful. Jeremy was one of those parents who didn't particularly relish the prospect of fatherhood. In an interview with Billboard in 2015, <a href=#>Justin said that Jeremy was an insecure parent</a> and "not in a place where he could raise a kid at that time." Not to mention the fact that Justin was reportedly unhappy with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy's controversial comments surrounding Pride 2023</a>.</p><p>Because of the complexities of Justin's connection with his father, his wife takes a more understated approach to their own. here’s what we know about the connection between Hailey and her father-in-law, Jeremy.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-rsquo-s-father-was-excited-for-his-son-rsquo-s-engagement-with-hailey-bieber>Justin Bieber’s Father Was Excited For His Son’s Engagement With Hailey Bieber</h2><p>In July 2018, Hailey was spotted hours after reportedly accepting the pop prince's proposal in the Bahamas, wearing a huge diamond sparkler and a dazzling smile. Neither Hailey nor Justin commented on their engagement, but both of their families took to social media to discuss the exciting development.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-8.png><p>After news spread that Justin had proposed on the trip, his father Jeremy Bieber posted a photo of a ring on Instagram, leaving followers to speculate.</p><p>"@justinbieber Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter!," a caption on a photo of the young Bieber on the beach.</p><p>Soon after, Justin’s mom, Pattie Mallette, tweeted "Love Love Love Love Love Love Love" with no absolutely no context or explanation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Justin was young, his father, Jeremy, and mother, Pattie, broke up. Although Justin is the sole biological child of Jeremy and Pattie, he has two younger half-siblings named Jazmyn and Jaxon on Jeremy’s side.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Justin Bieber Actually Regret Dating Selena Gomez When He Was Young?</a></span></p><p>At his father's wedding to his new stepmother Chelsey Rebelo in early 2018, Justin brought his then-girlfriend <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, which was one among many circumstances that led to a <a href=#>never-ending spiral of drama between Selena and Hailey</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-7.png><p>In that same event, Justin congratulated his father on his marriage on Instagram and welcomed the birth of a new child on the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Congrats on ur wedding and ur new baby!!" he wrote, alongside an image from the wedding ceremony. Little did people know that this baby would eventually become the topic of mass fan speculation.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-rsquo-s-father-had-people-believing-his-new-baby-was-hailey-rsquo-s>Justin Bieber’s Father Had People Believing His New Baby Was Hailey’s</h2><p>Fans were abuzz with rumors that Justin and Hailey were expecting a baby, when, in fact, the kid in question belonged to Justin's father.</p><p>Jeremy and Chelsey Bieber became parents to a daughter in August 2018, a month after Justin and Hailey got engaged. Justin was cradling his newborn sister, Bay, in a photo that his father shared with the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-5.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer was in big brother mode in the photo, which appeared to show him surrounded by all of the other Bieber siblings. Others, though, interpreted this as a display of newfound fatherhood. Adding more fuel to the fire, Jeremy captioned the image, "To be Father #Bieber's."</p><p>Because of how obscure the caption was, many people assumed the baby was Justin's. As soon as the news of Hailey's (fake) pregnancy spread, her followers flooded her social media pages with congratulations.</p><p>It's safe to assume that everyone made hasty assumptions. Since Jeremy used the plural tense in the post, some fans continued to speculate that Hailey was also expecting even after the mystery was debunked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-6.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Jeremy didn't mean to miscommunicate (as far as we can tell), the circumstance could have been intimidating for poor Hailey, who has been vocal about the fact that while she would like children one day, <a href=#>she is not yet prepared to be a parent</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The Thought Of Having Kids With Justin Bieber Makes Hailey 'Cry All The Time'</a></span></p><p>Hailey discussed her marriage to Justin and their aspirations to start a family in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. She had originally planned to start a family at a "super young" age, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but now she's decided to wait</a>.</p><p>“I think ideally in the next couple of years we would try. But there’s a reason they call it try, right? You don’t know how long that process is ever going to take,” she said. “Definitely no kids this year; that would be a little bit hectic, I think.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-6.png><p>The 26-year-old would rather concentrate on her professional ambitions, such as the launch of her new skincare line, Rhode. Since its inception a year ago, Hailey has been the "Creative of Everything" for the brand.</p><p>It's possible that Hailey and Justin will create a family in the future, but it's unlikely that a relative's poorly phrased Instagram caption will be how they break the news.</p><h2 id=how-often-do-justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber-see-jeremy-bieber>How Often Do Justin Bieber And Hailey Bieber See Jeremy Bieber?</h2><p>Justin posts pictures of himself and his wife Hailey on Instagram, as well as pictures of his friends, musical collaborators, and his family members. Justin's worlds collide with his father and wife quite frequently, despite his relationship’s constant state of repair with his father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeremy posted a black-and-white selfie of himself with his pop star kid in 2019. And if that wasn't cute enough, his daughter-in-law Hailey left them some sweet remarks showing her support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6-4.png><p>“Throwback and son,” Jeremy said in the caption of the photo with Justin, and the model responded with a red heart. Aw!</p><p>It doesn’t end there. Hailey is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">frequently in Bieber family outings</a>, displaying a strong bond with Justin’s parents, siblings, and relatives.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Hailey Baldwin's Net Worth Increased Over Ten Times Since Marrying Justin Bieber</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Justin's documentary series Justin Bieber: Seasons, he emphasizes family over everything else. They are his most ardent supporters, and he would go to any length to keep them happy and safe. However, he also recognized that it takes a lot of effort to create a pleasant, understanding relationship with his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/7-3.png><p>Justin spoke out a few years ago on Instagram, saying about his dad, "I love working through hard things to get to the good things," adding that he's still getting to know his father and that relationships are worth "fighting for."</p><p>As his wife, Hailey will undoubtedly have his back and cheer him on in anything he does, so it shouldn't come as a surprise if she also makes an effort to get along well with her father-in-law, even if he makes life a little hard for her with confusing captions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qo2KwsLrTq6avnaKptqK4jJ%2BYraCVp3qrsdGepLJlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FknZmlnLW1sdFmoKdlnJbEbrTAoqOesV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diana-lee-inosanto-parents-meet-dan-inosanto-sue-inosanto.html><span>←</span><span>Diana Lee Inosanto Parents: Meet Dan Inosanto, Sue Inosanto</span></a>
