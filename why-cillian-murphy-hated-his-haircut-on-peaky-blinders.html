With the varied characters and timeline that covers several decades, the series showcases phenomenal fashion statements.Despite the finest fashion on the show, one actor seems to hate his overall look. The 46-year-old Irish actor Cillian Murphy revealed his disapproval on his haircut on the show. So why does the actor hated his hairstyling on Peaky Blinders?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cillian-murphy-detests-his-hairstyle-on-peaky-blinders>Cillian Murphy Detests His Hairstyle On Peaky Blinders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar49829115.jpg><p>Historical drama series Peaky Blinders is set in the 1920s Birmingham. The crime series is widely known for its remarkable well-dressed characters that creative a massive following. Peaky Blinders is such a great show and loved by the fans that they even wanted to imitate the 1920s getup from the show including the hairstyle of the casts.</p><p>But as it turns out, the star Peaky Blinders himself, <a href=#>Cillian Murphy playing as Tommy Shelby</a>, hates his trademark haircut on the show. The actor who has been playing the role since 2013 reveals his dislike towards his famous haircut. He does not particularly hate it, but he’s just used to having a long hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did 'Peaky Blinders' Have A Bad Final Season?">Did 'Peaky Blinders' Have A Bad Final Season?</a></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans apparently love the haircut </a>and Murphy is surprised that everyone seems to have developed a thing for it. During his 2017 interview, he tells Shortlist “But people like the undercut thing; people go to the barber and ask for a ‘Peaky cut’. It’s crazy that people like it, it’s not grown on me in four years now. I normally keep my hair long.”</p><p>He continued "Do realize the people in turtlenecks in Hackney with this haircut, do they realize it was styled this way to prevent lice? Tell em they have got the lice cut, see what they say then."</p><h2 id=the-styling-on-peaky-blinders-was-based-on-the-mug-shots-of-the-early-20th-century>The Styling On Peaky Blinders Was Based On The Mug Shots Of The Early 20th Century</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Costume designer Stephanie Collie was the one who conceptualized the styling on the show.

The team pretty much based the costume of the series on the criminal mug shots from the early 20th century.</p><p>Costume designer Stephanie Collie tells Esquire “You could see everything in so much detail: the cufflinks, the tie-pins, the textures." She believes that the reason the costume on the show was a great hit among the fans was because every Englishman unconsciously wanted to wear a suit. She commented "Because, at heart, I think every Englishman wants to wear a suit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-peaky-blinders-creators-made-sure-to-monetize-the-clamor-on-the-show>The Peaky Blinders Creators Made Sure To Monetize The Clamor On The Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar49829170-1.jpg><p>Despite <a href=#>Peaky Blinders' star Cillian Murphy</a>’s indifference towards his haircut, the people behind the series are happy with the public’s response to it. Even football icon David Beckham fancies the overall styling of Tommy Shelby, which resulted in an official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peaky Blinders-inspired clothing</a> and merchandises.</p><p>Peaky Blinders’ creator Steven Knight gladly explained "David is a big fan, so is his son, and they approached us and said they wanted to do a Peaky Blinders capsule range… By the end of series four it became very obvious around the world there was a thing happening. That is when we started looking at a full range of products."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Beckham reached out to the producers</a> of Peaky Blinders to collaborate.
