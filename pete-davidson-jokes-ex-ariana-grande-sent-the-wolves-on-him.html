Just a few weeks later, Us Weekly broke the news that they were engaged.</p><p>The former couple’s romance was very public, with a <a href=#>trip to Disneyland</a>, jokes about the <a href=#>size of the stand-up comedian’s penis</a>, <a href=#>matching tattoos</a> and a <a href=#>red carpet appearance</a> at the MTV Video Music Awards. However, Grande <a href=#>called off their engagement</a> in October 2018, one month after her ex <a href=#>Miller died at age 26</a> from an accidental drug overdose.</p><p>Davidson admitted during an interview in February that he knew his whirlwind relationship with the “Thank U, Next” singer was <a href=#>“over after” the rapper’s death</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That was really horrible, and I can’t imagine what that s–t is like,” he told radio personality&nbsp;<strong>Charlamagne Tha God</strong>. “All I do know is that she really loved the s–t out of him and she wasn’t, like, putting on a show or anything.”</p><p>After Grande, the Big Time Adolescence star had short-lived romances with <a href=#><strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Margaret Qualley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>. The Victorious alum, meanwhile, casually dated Social House member <strong>Mikey Foster</strong>; Us broke the news earlier this month that <a href=#>they are no longer an item</a>.</p><p>When asked about Davidson <a href=#>becoming a ladies’ man</a> as of late,&nbsp;SNL’s <a href=#><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong></a> told&nbsp;Us exclusively in November 2019, “He’s a good boy. It’s not like he’s a bad guy necessarily. He has a great sense of humor. He’s a fun, good, loving kid. He loves his mother. And he’s everything a girl would like. So it’s not surprising the girls like him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYrewt8SsZJ6wXZa%2Fqq3NmmSgqpGjsaZ50p6lrWWknbJuw86lrZ6rXaS7brTIpmSsoJViuqKwxGaknmWWlrqwwdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nelson-mandela-s-youngest-daughter-has-died.html><span>←</span><span>Nelson Mandela's Youngest Daughter Has Died</span></a>
