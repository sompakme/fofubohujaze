According to Rated R&B, You Will Do Great Things follows a young boy whose “imagination takes off as he gazes at family photos, whisking him off on a fantastical journey.

In the caption of an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post shared</a> on Aug. 9, Amerie pointed out how Figueroa’s “breathtakingly rich, poignant works of art” brings to life what she ultimately wanted to convey—”the very strong, very universal thing every parent who loves their child feels: that we will be forever by their side, cheering them on.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As Amerie has already served as editor for the 2017 best-selling book Because You Love To Hate Me, she has also contributed to the upcoming novel <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cool. Awkward. Black</a>, a multi-genre young adult fiction anthology that explores the idea of being a “geek.” The book also offers a collective of feature stories from other Black authors, including Kalynn Bayron, Terry J. Benton-Walker, Roseanne A. Brown, Elise Bryant, and more. Cool. Awkward. Black.&nbsp;is scheduled to release on Jan. 10, 2023 via Viking Books for Young Readers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although she has been mum about the possibility of new music, her debut 2002 album&nbsp;All I Have just celebrated its 20th anniversary on July 30.
