Gucci&nbsp;even gave the production unlimited access to the fashion house’s vintage archive so every detail is authentic.</p><p>Of course, more goes into creating a <a href=#>Hollywood</a> film’s wardrobe than just sourcing beautiful 1980s clothes. Creating these upscale 1980s looks, and was the work of Oscar-winning costume designer Janty Yates – and it’s not her first time working with Hollywood superstars.</p><h1>Ridley Scott’s Upcoming Film “House of Gucci”</h1><p>Acclaimed director and producer Ridley Scott is famous for his work on films like Alien, Gladiator, and The Martian, but his upcoming film that’s a little closer to home than space or ancient Rome. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Based on the book</a>, “The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed” by Sara Gay Forden, the film follows the sensational mystery around the shocking death of Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the famous fashion designer Guccio Gucci.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The star-studded film</a> has not only Lady Gaga and Adam Driver as the leads Patrizia Reggiani and Maurizio Gucci, but Al Pacino as Aldo Gucci, Jared Leto as Paolo Gucci, and Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo Gucci.</p><p>While the film dives into the infighting that occurred within the Gucci family, the modern day <a href=#>Gucci</a> brand appears to be excited about the upcoming film and publicity, not to mention all the stars wearing Gucci. They have given the production full access to the fashion house’s vintage archives for all their costuming needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film is currently set to open on November 4th. While many films this year have had to be pushed back due to COVID-19 restrictions, this release date places “House of Gucci” perfectly to be considered for <a href=#>Academy Awards</a> – including for costume design.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gucci Debuts Harry Styles In New Luxury Campaign</a></span></p><h2 id=1980s-high-fashion-looks-courtesy-of-gucci>1980s High Fashion Looks – Courtesy of Gucci</h2><p>Adam Driver and Lady Gaga shared their looks in the now widely-shared Instagram post perfectly encapsulates the couple’s status as 1980s New York elite – an image that the Guccis would have certainly have had. Driver (as Reggiani) wears a cream cable-knit sweater with a white ski suit tied at the waist and extremely period-appropriate aviator glasses. Gaga (as Reggiani) wears an all black suit, multiple gold chains, pearls, big clip-on earrings, and a big white fur hat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga has also been seen on set in a vintage Burberry plaid coat, a red wrap dress with a sable coat, and an oversized cream-colored fur coat with a belted white lace dress. Possibly Gaga’s most impressive look, however, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her wedding dress</a>. The bridal look is perfect for the era, with an A-line silhouette, lace floral details, long sheer sleeves and a sweetheart neckline.</p><p>Jared Leto will be wearing a Western-style corduroy suit, and a vintage Gucci tie in green, with tan loafers. Al Pacino has been spotted in a beige suit, mustard yellow tie, and a striped shirt with a pop of blue in his pocket square.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the pieces that Yates utilized in the film are still available for sale by Gucci – and it's no surprise that the brand is pleased to have them featured in an upcoming film, but most are vintage and no longer available. With all the buzz around Gaga's looks, some are wondering if Gucci will capitalize on the boost with some more vintage-inspired pieces.</p><h3 id=janty-yates-and-the-creative-team-behind-house-of-gucci>Janty Yates and the Creative Team Behind "House of Gucci"</h3><p>Oscar-winner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janty Yates</a> is no stranger to major Hollywood films. She has created looks for major films like Miami Vice, Gladiator, and Hannibal.</p><p>While all eyes are on Yates’s incredible work bringing the <a href=#>fashion</a> of the film to life right now, once the film opens audiences will be able to see the work the rest of the creative team has put into perfecting the luxurious 80s look of the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Acclaimed cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has described</a> the challenge of getting the look of getting the high fashion look for the period right: “This film, because it’s high fashion ’80s and ’90s, it’s going to be a little different. I’m still trying to find a look for it. The ‘80s weren’t a particularly good-looking period. The fashion world or these fashion shows, they were not that great looking. You look at the big coats and stuff and [go] hmm… So it’s a bit of a kitschy, funny, tragic tragedy — like a high-end soap opera. With a crazy cast as well.”</p><p>According to legendary production designer Arthur Max, director Ridley Scott has his hands in everything on all the films he works on to make sure the details are right: “[Scott is] Like a tiger, I just hold onto his tail,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max said</a>, “If you don’t hold on, you never know what will happen! The exceptional thing about Ridley is that he knows everything. He really does; editing, camera, production and design. He takes your good idea and turns it into a brilliant idea. He’s a visual genius.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Signs 2 Year Deal With Dom Pérignon, 'The Queendom'</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The House of Gucci</a>, <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>, <a href=#>Janty Yates</a>, <a href=#>nfts</a>, <a href=#>indiewire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMHSnmSgrZOYtm64wJ2wZp%2BRnK5urcOapGacop7Dpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./easter-egg-oreos-to-debut-in-spring-2019.html><span>←</span><span>Easter Egg Oreos to Debut in Spring 2019</span></a>
