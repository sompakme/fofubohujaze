The Kardashians alum shared a series of photos of herself in a white, ethereal Dolce & Gabbana dress. Kim couldn’t help but hype her up in the comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What seemed like a sweet comment quickly turned into a debacle when someone replied to Kim’s comment, only to make fun of her infamous behind. “hey Pamper booty,” the person wrote. The comment got the attention of Khloe, who was quick to reply with a jab at the person’s eyebrows in their profile picture. “hey blocked brows,” Khloe, 39, wrote back.</p><p>Several other followers were quick to defend the critics and point out that Khloe’s reply was not necessary. “[I would] rather have blocked brows that’s easy [to take] off than a saggy diaper,” one person responded to Khloe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Reignites Feud With Kylie Minogue As She Tries To Trademark Her Name Again</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the Good American founder doubled down on her stance. “Those things are tatted on but a hater is going to hate. That ass is ass’n but you do you baby that’s why we have so many flavors,” Khloe responded. “Not everyone has the same taste. sending you love and a little bit of agua. You seem thirsty my love,” she continued.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Kim was the original target of the critic’s pamper comment, the makeup mogul never directly replied, unlike Khloe. Nevertheless, some comments praised Khloe for sticking up for Kim.</p><p>“I’m so proud you gave it back to her,” one comment said, while another read, “This might be the best clap back I’ve read.” A different person wrote, “I f—king love you!!! I fiercely protect my sister too.”</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-jenners-have-been-dodging-plastic-surgery-rumors-for-years>The Kardashian-Jenners Have Been Dodging Plastic Surgery Rumors For Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kylie-jenner-accused-of-more-plastic-surgery-after-recently-admitting-to-a-boob-job-following-nearly-a-decade-of-speculation.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is hardly the first time the Kardashian’s bodies have been criticized or they’ve been the subject of plastic surgery speculation. Khloe and Kim’s younger sister, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, recently found herself on the receiving end of backlash when her followers thought they could spot new work done in a recent IG post.</p><p>Fans began <a href=#>theorizing that Kylie had her facial filler dissolved</a>, as he was sporting a more natural look, as her cheeks appeared flattr and her lip thinner. Kylie has admitted to getting her lip filler dissolved in the past but hasn’t addressed the recent speculation about her face.</p><p>However, the makeup mogul did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently admit to undergoing breast augmentation at the age of 19</a>, after many years of denying having work done to her body except her lips. Opening up on The Kardashians, Kylie says she regrets the boob job, as she got pregnant with her daughter, Stormi, so soon after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It took Kylie nearly a decade to admit to having her breasts done, and there are many theories still floating around about what work the Kardashian-Jenners have had done, even though they insist to being natural for the most part.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7brTAq6qhZaekv6W%2FjJ%2BYp2WSpLG6edKhmKadXaC2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK60manpZmjqbakedKuqaCdoq56s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-martin-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Martin Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
