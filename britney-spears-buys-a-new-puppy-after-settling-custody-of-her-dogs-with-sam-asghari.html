However, there’s been speculation that Sam wants to challenge the terms of their prenup.</p><p>“[Sam] has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party,” court documents filed by Sam’s legal team stated, leading some to believe he’s questioning what he’s entitled to.</p><p>"There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to [Sam] at this time,” the filing went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Iranian native is apparently only entitled to $1 million after 2 year of marriage, to be capped at $15 million after 10 years together. But since the pair were only married for a little over a year, Sam may get nothing from the divorce.</p><p>“[Sam is] attempting to negotiate concessions beyond his prenup and threatening to go public with extraordinarily embarrassing information about Britney unless he gets paid,” <a href=#>an insider claimed to Page Six</a>. “So that’s what Sam is focused on.</p><p>Sam has denied the speculation that he’s challenging the prenup, releasing a statement through his representative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There are many claims that Sam is challenging the prenup and threatening to exploit his ex-wife with videos,” his rep said. “However, all these claims are false, as no negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be. Sam has always and will always support her.”</p><p>Sam and Britney’s divorce remains ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kroy Biermann Files To Divorce Kim Zolciak A Second Time Over Financial Problems</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8GroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZKqxrR5wGalnq9dpcKxvNhmmJ%2Bslad6tLHTraOippdisLa%2F06ibsmWfm3qpsdFmm6ifo2LEqsDHZqqapV2WwKi0wKugaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-brother-fans-are-praising-claire-for-leaving-750-000-behind-so-the-cookout-alliance-can-advance.html><span>←</span><span>Big Brother Fans Are Praising Claire For Leaving $750,000 Behind So The Cookout Alliance Can Advance</span></a>
