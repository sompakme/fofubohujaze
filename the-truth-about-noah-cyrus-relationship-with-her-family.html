"Being born in the family I was in, everybody gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley's little sister, but I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a s*** about due to what people said to me online," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is Noah Cyrus Famous Because Of Miley?">Is Noah Cyrus Famous Because Of Miley?</a></span></p><p>"It was absolutely unbearable," she continued, adding, "And that's why I write, 'My sister's like sunshine / Always bringing good light wherever she'll go / And I was born to rain clouds / Blessed in her shadows.' Because that's why everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow. And I always believed that, and that's so hard for me to overcome."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noah-cyrus-lost-her-identity-due-to-being-miley-39-s-little-sister><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Noah Cyrus Lost Her Identity Due To Being Miley's Little Sister</span></h2><p>Noah Cyrus also said that growing up with such a famous sister made her lose her identity as a child.

Are you Miley Cyrus's sister? Are you Hannah Montana's sister?"</p><p>"That made me feel like I had no identity as a child," she admitted. "When I say child, Hannah Montana started before I was seven years old. So by the time I was seven I was asked that my entire life until I decided to make my music, make a name for myself and do my own thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-miley-cyrus-and-noah-cyrus-similar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Are Miley Cyrus And Noah Cyrus Similar?</span></h2><p>Despite sharing the same surname and similar careers in the entertainment industry, the pair are very similar.
