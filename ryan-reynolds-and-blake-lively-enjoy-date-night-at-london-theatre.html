The lovebirds took in a performance of Matilda the Musical before posing with the cast for a photo op.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“The talent. The athleticism. The hammer throw to end all hammer throws,” Reynolds, 46,<a href=#> wrote via his Instagram Stories</a> alongside a snap from the evening out, referencing one of Matilda’s most iconic scenes.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">For their night on the town, Lively and Reynolds kept it London chic, with the<a href=#> Gossip Girl </a>alum donning black slacks and a gray plaid blazer. The <a href=#>Deadpool</a> star, meanwhile, complemented his wife in gray slacks, white sneakers and a matching collared shirt.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The couple have been spending time in the U.K. while Reynolds — <a href=#>who co-owns British soccer team Wrexham AFC</a> — shoots the third Deadpool movie. Lively has been busy with her film <a href=#>It Ends With Us</a>, but both projects have been put on hold due to the recent SAG-AFTRA strike.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">For now, Lively and Reynolds are seemingly enjoying their downtime — and an occasional reprieve from their little ones. Last month, Lively took to social media to announce her Betty Booze cocktail line, which she revealed were seemingly inspired by her children taking up all her energy.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“BettyBooze at your service. These are recipes I’ve been making for loved ones for years. But I have 4 kids now. <a href=#>And I’m tired</a>. So here they are. In a can. Enjoy. Responsibly. … Ish,” she wrote via her Instagram Stories&nbsp;at the time.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Reynolds, for his part, has also been vocal about his kids occasionally wearing him out. In June he teased how being a father of four inspired his new Fubo TV series,&nbsp;Bedtime Stories.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“The idea for a show made to help everyone fall asleep<a href=#> was born the same day as my fourth child</a>,” he quipped via Instagram alongside the trailer for the new program. “I can’t wait for you to watch&nbsp;Bedtime Stories.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While Lively and Reynolds — who tied the knot in 2012 — may be overwhelmed with a busy house, they still find time to keep their romance alive. The pair often playfully troll — and swoon — over&nbsp;each other via social media. In May, Lively <a href=#>melted over Reynolds’ toned summer body</a>.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“Summer in New York makes me sorry for the way I treated winter in New York,” Reynolds captioned a sultry Instagram snap that showed off his biceps. Lively, meanwhile reported the image with surrounding emojis of sriracha sauce, peppers and a sign that read: “Caution: Extra Spicy.”<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerOx2KempZyjYq6vsIybo5qjlWK5qsLEpbBmnZ6fvLp5w5qrnmWenrSpwIyaq2akn6OxsLqMrZ%2BemaSnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-bobby-goodson-make-latest-bobby-goodson-net-worth-income-salary.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Bobby Goodson Make?
