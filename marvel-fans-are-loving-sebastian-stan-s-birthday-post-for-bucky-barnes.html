Bucky was first introduced in the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger, and has reprised his role in several MCU movies ever since.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Before Playing Bucky Barnes, Sebastian Stan Auditioned For This MCU Hero</a></span></p><h2 id=sebastian-stan-is-bucky-s-biggest-fan>Sebastian Stan Is Bucky's Biggest Fan</h2><p>Stan penned a special message on Bucky’s birthday, and poked fun at his many hairstyles. He also shared a rare photo of himself getting his hair done in the dressing room, and stunt choreography sequences from his Civil War filming days.</p><p>“We been through some interesting fights. And hairstyles,” he wrote to Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were in awe of the actor acknowledging Bucky’s birthday, and flooded the comments section with love for them both!</p><p>“the way ur bucky’s biggest fan omg” wrote @abigaillkimball</p><p>@sebastianfan shared “We love to see it. He doesn’t look a day over 35.” Bucky is actually 107!</p><p>@sylviemartin penned “long hair bucky, gone but never forgotten.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Chris Evans Or Sebastian Stan?</a></span></p><p>When the trailer and posters for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier were released, fans were mourning their biggest loss already: Bucky’s long hair.</p><p>The actor's&nbsp;portrayal of Bucky is easy&nbsp;on the eyes, compared to the comic-book character’s somewhat scrawny appearance. It is no surprise that the actor had to grow a beard and sport longer hair to look the part as the Winter Soldier/Hydra assassin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hero-turned-villain-turned-hero-again served as a former sidekick to Captain America before becoming the Winter Soldier, thanks to Hydra’s brainwashing program.</p><p>In the new series, Marvel fans expect that Bucky will be forced to confront his past and the events that ensued during the Winter Soldier brainwashing program, as he finally moves past traumatic experiences.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes work together especially since&nbsp;they haven’t spent any time together! Steve Rogers has been a best friend to Bucky and a mentor to Sam, so it is likely that Captain America’s last good deed in the world is bringing these superheroes together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier premieres on Disney+ on March 19!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What To Expect From Marvel's New Disney Plus Show 'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqmmrlussCnqmaZopp6rbvVoqWgZaOar6K%2F06KYp2Wjqa6vv4yboKusmJmuunnPqKqtZZakv26u1JyismWSlr%2BvsdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-michael-brophy-tattoo-what-is-the-inside-story-with-cardi-b.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Michael Brophy Tattoo: What Is The Inside Story With Cardi B?</span></a>
