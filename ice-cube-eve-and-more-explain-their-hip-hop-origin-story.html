Specifically, Cube named classic records like Malcolm McLauren’s “Buffalo Gals,” Zapp’s “More Bounce to the Ounce,” Sugarhill Gang’s “8th Wonder,” and Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick’s “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234643902>La Di Da Di</a>” as the ones that “turned me on to rap.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The one rapper, though, who truly influenced the 54-year-old at a young age was <a href=# id=auto-tag_krs-one data-tag=krs-one>KRS-One</a>. The former NWA member explained, “He had a lot of different styles, a lot of different techniques. And he had one of the coldest names ever when you broke it down: Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone. He was an <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234731880>in-your-face rapper</a> who came with style and intelligence. ‘Criminal Minded,’ ‘The Blueprint’ — masterpieces. He’s just one of the best that ever blessed the mic.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Eve, she credited the<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234735789> female rap pioneers</a> for why she chose to pursue a career in Hip-Hop.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“A lot of the reason I went into Hip-Hop was the females. What I saw in them was women who were holding their own up against the boys, but still celebrating their femininity,” she shared. “<a href=# id=auto-tag_mc-lyte data-tag=mc-lyte>MC Lyte</a>’s ‘Cappucino’ — I can totally remember the video. What was I, 10? I thought she was so damn fly. She had this long black coat on, but then her hair was stacked and shaved in the back. I wanted to get my hair cut like hers.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Experiences like that even lead her to forming her <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234727833>own girl group</a> titled DGP — Dope Girl Posse. However, once she got serious in high school and began listening to<a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234770688> Lil Kim</a> and The Notorious B.I.G., her flow changed for the better.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The former <a href=#>first lady of Ruff Ryders </a>continued, “It was always important for me just to be good — not good for a girl.&nbsp;I looked at those cyphers as honing my skills. I never turned one down… My full name was pretty much ‘Eve, That Girl With the Blonde Hair That Can Rap.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With the help of Missy Elliott, <a href=# id=auto-tag_trina data-tag=trina>Trina</a>, Lauryn Hill, and Queen Latifah, Eve later saw how her career could <a href=#>“transcend” within music</a> and beyond.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out other <a href=# rel=nofollow>first-hand accounts</a> from Q-Tip, Lil Wayne, Cardi B, Roxanne Shanté, MC Lyte, Trina, DMC, Bun B, LL Cool J, and more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX56wpnnCrpmeZZWrsm60yKlkoaegYryztcaipaxlYWeAdYOWbG5qcV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./graeme-hart-net-worth-wife-wiki-biography-age-children-new-zealand-billionaire.html><span>←</span><span>Graeme Hart Net Worth, Wife, Wiki, Biography, Age, Children New Zealand Billionaire</span></a>
