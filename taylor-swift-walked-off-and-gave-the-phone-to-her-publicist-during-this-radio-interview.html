In one moment, she actually left a radio interview, only to hand the phone to her publicist. Let's look back at how it all went down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-taylor-swift-leave-her-radio-interview>Why Did Taylor Swift Leave Her Radio Interview?</h2><p>The situation took place years back following the disaster that took place between Kanye West and Taylor Swift at the VMAs. Kanye and Taylor were able to reconnect after the moment took place, with Swift initially wanting Kanye's respect, “I started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me — because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me,” Swift explains. “When someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, ‘This guy who’s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.’ But that’s where I was.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>A Brief History of Lawsuits Taylor Swift Has Been Involved In</a></span></p><p>Things would go in the opposite direction once again in 2015 when West was accepting the Vanguard Award. Behind the scenes, Kanye had asked Swift to present the award, and he convinced her to do so with some very kind words and a lengthy phone conversation.</p><p>However, things took a turn when Kanye accepted the award from Taylor, stating in his speech that Swift presenting the award was done for ratings... That did not sit well with Swift, “I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, things weren't smooth for Taylor, as she was forced to talk about Kanye in several interviews. Though in this particular conversation, the star had enough.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-was-done-answering-kanye-west-questions>Taylor Swift Was Done Answering Kanye West Questions</h2><p>The interview started off with a Kanye West question following the 2009 ordeal that had taken place. To Swift's credit, she answered the question as well as she could, stating that she was blessed with the outpouring of love from the fans.</p><p>However, it seems like the host would not let off the question, once again asking Swift about her thoughts on the moment. Taylor would state that she didn't want to make it into something bigger than it already was. She would later suggest that they talk about something else, given that she already discussed the topic in other interviews.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Truth About Andy Cohen And Taylor Swift's Complicated Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The host was insistent, telling Taylor, "let me give you some tips here, you've got ten or twelve radio stations lined up after me and they're all going to want to talks about this Taylor."</p><p>Finally, Swift had enough with the interview, asking three times to switch topics. She handed the phone over to her publicist, and would refuse to say goodbye to the show, despite the host's requests. It was a tough moment and one that was not easy to watch.</p><h2 id=what-did-fans-think-of-the-moment>What Did Fans Think Of The Moment</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The clip was re-posted in February of 2021 to YouTube, and it already has more than half a million views. What should not come as a surprise is that support Taylor Swift received from the fans on both YouTube and Reddit. Here's what the people had to say.</p><p>"He sounded like he really wanted to control her and didn’t like that she was creating a boundary and sticking to it. Plus his patronizing advice about how this will help her career was so annoying."</p><p>"I remember an interview she did in the Red era where she brought all the people there homemade mint cookies. Her interviewer was so unnecessarily rude and ungrateful. Constantly interrupting and deliberately misunderstanding her humor. "Did you make them for us or are they leftovers?" like eff off man. I don't even remember his name. My brain suppressed the memory of that cringe interview."</p><p>"She was so young in this, but so well spoken, professional, and respectful. always has been, always will be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She was literally a teenager."</p><p>Clearly, the top comments were not impressed with the interviewer, while praising Taylor for her composure at such a young age.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Fans Are Looking At This Rude Bruce Willis Interview Differently Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lp5a5rLHDZqafnl2ZwrO1zaBkq5mUnrxutc2tnKuumZrEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suzie-ketcham-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Suzie Ketcham Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
