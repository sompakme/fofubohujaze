Most recently, the reality star received a comment on an Instagram post that he felt compelled to directly respond to.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Erika Girardi Loses Fight To Keep $750,000 Earrings From Husband</a></span></p><p>The post featured a photo of the couple alongside a couple of friends as well as Amy Roloff, Matt’s ex-wife. Amy’s new husband, Chris Marek, was also featured in the photo.</p><p>“After 2 weeks in Arizona visiting my folks, Caryn’s folks and having kids and grands down to enjoy the warmth,” Matt captioned the picture.</p><p>He continued, “We come back to the farm to have these dear friends of 30+ years come out from Texas to hang with us for a few days. As Brian would say in his Texas accent, ‘It’s been a mighty fine time y’all!!’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Hope you’re getting a [prenup], Matt,” a so-called fan commented on Sunday, June 26. Matt was quick to reply, implying that it’s his girlfriend who has more to lose if they don’t sign a prenuptial arrangement.</p><p>“Since she has a net worth 3x my worth. I hope she lets me sneak by,” Matt wrote. “Caryn’s net wealth will surprise you,” he said. “I need her to try [to] keep up.”</p><p>Matt and Caryn have dodged engagement rumors for the majority of their relationship. Though they’ve been together for five years, the couple seem to be in no rush of officially tying the knot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last May, Matt shared a sweet tribute post to Instagram for his girlfriend’s birthday. "<a href=#>Happy Birthday to the most fabulous person</a> in the world,” he wrote. “You’re amazing Caryn and you touch so many people with your sweet joy and beautiful spirit!”</p><p>Many fans commented about how cute the lovey-dovey post was. One follower even said, “Marry that woman!" To this, Matt clarified that marriage isn’t off the table, "Maybe I will !! You'll have to wait and see,” he replied.</p><p>Matt is reportedly worth a cool $6 million. In addition to his family’s long-running tint on Little People, Big World, Matt also owns and operates a 34-actre farm in Oregon. It’s reported that his family members <a href=#>make anywhere between $1,500 to $3,000</a> per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While an engagement may still be up in the air, there’s no denying that viewers would be thrilled to see a televised wedding between these two reality stars.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Swizz Beats Gifts Alicia Keys 150-Carat Necklace Worth $400,000</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>In Touch Weekly</a>, <a href=#>In Touch Weekly</a>, <a href=#>The Sun</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6osDTZqmopJ%2Bbs267zWanq52eqr1ur86nq6unppq%2FtMWMprBmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWdlrimv4xsr2alqWLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masi-oka-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Masi Oka Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
