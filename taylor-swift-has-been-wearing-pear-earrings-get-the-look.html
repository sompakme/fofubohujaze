Of course, the brand had exactly what we were looking for with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pear-shaped studs</a>. They come in yellow gold — as well as white gold and rose gold — and are available in two sizes. The best part? Both sizes are currently priced the same, so you can simply pick your preference!</p><p>These earrings have a three-prong design with a glimmering cubic zirconia stone in the center that closely replicates a diamond’s shine. The metal is made from 925 sterling silver and coated in gold plating for the perfect finish. Another cool aspect? You can wear them with the point up, down or even to the side. Swift has multiple holes in her ears, and she wears hers a little up the ear, mixing and matching with other earrings. That’s another styling idea for you!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pavoi 14K Gold-Plated Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Stud Earrings</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$13</a> at Amazon!
