At San Diego’s Comic-Con this past July, the cast and producers <a href=#>did their first panel without</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Dobrev.</strong></p><p>“Of course it’s bittersweet [to be here without Nina],” creator <strong>Julie Plec</strong> said at the time. Elena is not technically dead, however — the character is essentially asleep in a coffin for the next 60 to 70 years until BFF Bonnie, to whom she is supernaturally linked, eventually dies. Hence, her spirit lives on.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought it was a really clever way to keep Elena there and keep her presence there and keep the door open in a lot of ways for her to come back,” Graham said on the panel. “But it also created an interesting dynamic going into Season 7 for Bonnie and Damon and them to have to deal with the fact that Bonnie’s alive and Elena’s not.”</p><p>Season 7 of The Vampire Diaries will premiere on Oct. 8 on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBuwMSaqp6qXZuyosDUq5ysZZ6WuKawjKKYp2WjpLqmvseao52domLEosDCoWRraGFqgHGFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-joined-by-bradley-cooper-and-gigi-hadid-in-romantic-getaway.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Joined By Bradley Cooper And Gigi Hadid In Romantic Getaway</span></a>
