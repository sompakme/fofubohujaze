As for who she gets all her advice from, that comes in the form of her cat, Salem, voiced by <strong>Nick Bakay</strong>.</p><p>“I probably identify with Clarissa the most. Although I know that more people identified and felt very akin to Sabrina,” Hart <a href=#>told Us Weekly exclusively</a> in 2017 when looking back on the role, referring to her role in Clarissa Explains It All, which she led from 1991 to 1994. “But I have to say the most fun role was Mel in Melissa & Joey for me. The other two were always fixing things and could solve problems and what not. But as Mel, I got to be the tornado that tore everything apart. It was like the Lucy character. The one that was always getting in trouble and causing a riot!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see what the cast is up to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BorqO%2ByKeYZqyYmnq1scSnmKCdXay2ta%2FHZpqaq6RixKmx0Z5kmqqVYsGpsdhmpaivXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willie-e-gary-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Willie E.
