Of course like any parent, Ted took a roundabout way of getting to the point, telling a long-winded story that ran for nine seasons from 2005-2014, and focused on just about everyone else he dated prior to meeting their mom – in total, about 30 different women!</p><p>Viewers didn’t find out until the final season who “mom” was, and while she was great, <a href=#>people hated how the series ended</a>. Not only (spoiler alert) was mom now deceased, but Ted seemed to continue to hold a torch for ex-girlfriend and long-time friend Robin who appears to have been “the one” all along. Way to ruin an otherwise great sitcom!</p><p>Nonetheless, the series that saw a revolving door of female guest stars teasing us that each might be&nbsp;the eventual wife, from Jennifer Morrison to Becki Newton, Sarah Chalke, Rachel Bilson, and Katie Holmes. All of the stories also centered on Ted and his four closest friends: Marshall, Lily, Barney, and Robin, as they navigated life in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here’s a look at the net worth of each cast member, along with other notable actors from the series, according to <a href=#>CelebrityNetWorth.com</a>, along with what they’re up to now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Brands Millennials Are Killing According To Older Generations</a></span></p><h2 id=josh-radnor-20-million><strong>Josh Radnor ($20 million)</strong></h2><p>“Ha-aave you met Ted?” Worth about $20 million, earning a reported $225,000 per episode toward the end of How I Met Your Mother’s run, the role of Ted has been Radnor’s most notable to date. In 2010, he made his writing and directorial debut with a comedy/drama called Happythankyoumoreplease, which earned him a Sundance Film Festival audience award.</p><p>He shifted to Broadway in 2014, performing in Disgraced, then starred in series like Mercy Street and Rise. He’s currently filming a new series called The Hunt about Nazi hunters in the ‘70s.</p><h2 id=jason-segel-40-million><strong>Jason Segel ($40 million)</strong></h2><p>Arguably the most famous of the cast when the series began, Segel has had a long career in comedy films and television, most notably gaining fame on the short-lived but cult Judd Apatow series Freaks and Geeks along with James Franco, Seth Rogen, and Linda Cardellini.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his time on HIMYM, for which he also reportedly received $225,000 per episode for playing Ted’s best friend and doting husband to Lily, he also starred in a long list of comedic films like Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bad Teacher, and This is 40. He also penned a couple of young adult novels in the late ‘10s, and in 2015, was praised for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the biographical film The End of the Tour. He has some projects in the works, including a series called Dispatches from Elsewhere that is in the pre-production stage and set for release in 2020.</p><h2 id=cobie-smulders-18-million><strong>Cobie Smulders ($18 million)</strong></h2><p>Raking in $225,000 per episode along with the rest of the main cast for her role as the gal pal who also dated both Ted and Barney on and off (and ended up marrying Barney), Smulders has enjoyed tremendous success post-HIMYM thanks to her role as agent Maria Hill in six Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, starting with The Avengers in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also had a role alongside Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back in 2017 and played the Mother in Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events.&nbsp;She most recently starred in another Netflix series, Friends From College, which ran for two seasons but has since been canceled. She’ll reprise her MCU role for <a href=#>Spider-Man: Far From Home</a>,&nbsp;and also appears as a young Lucille in Arrested Development.</p><h2 id=neil-patrick-harris-40-million><strong>Neil Patrick Harris ($40 million)</strong></h2><p>A bona fide child star when the series began, the role of the womanizing, unfeeling but <a href=#>utterly hilarious Barney Stinson</a> helped Harris shed the Doogie Howser, M.D. moniker that had followed him for so long. Depositing a cool $225,000 into his bank account after each episode – which is truly legen- (wait for it) -dary - , Harris has dipped his hand in many other projects, both during his time on the series as well as after.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Entire Modern Family Cast Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to appearing in A Series of Unfortunate Events, American Horror Story: Freak Show, the movie Gone Girl, and doing voice work for animated films like The Smurfs, he also appeared on Broadway and hosted the Tony, Emmy, and the Academy Awards. Whew! Harris is next set to appear in a biography called Anita about beauty queen and singer Anita Bryant who became an advocate for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the ‘70s.</p><h2 id=alyson-hannigan-30-million><strong>Alyson Hannigan ($30 million)</strong></h2><p>Reportedly hand-picked for the role of Lily, who was based on writer Craig Thomas’ own wife, Hannigan was best known at the time as Willow Rosenberg from&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Michelle Flaherty in the American Pie films.</p><p>She voiced several characters on animated series Robot Chicken from 2011-2018, which provided some steady funds added to her $225K per episode HIMYM salary. Since the series ended, she has served as host of the TV series Penn & Teller: Fool Us, and played Kim’s mother in the Disney Channel movie Kim Possible, which is based on the animated series. Most recently, she was in the TV series Pure.</p><h2 id=lyndsy-fonseca-2-million><strong>Lyndsy Fonseca ($2 million)</strong></h2><p>Her name might not be recognizable, but Fonseca appeared in 65 episodes of the series through its run. It was only in brief clips, playing the exasperated daughter Penny who wished her dad Ted would just get to the end of the story, already! The 32-year-old’s income stems from the show (they filmed all segments at once to avoid the kids appearing noticeably older), as well as a role on daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless, which she held from 2001-2005.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Net Worth Of The Entire Walking Dead Cast (Past & Present)</a></span></p><p>She worked simultaneously, and after, on many other projects, including in the series Nikita, Marvel’s Agent Carter, and the movie Kick-Ass and its sequel.</p><h2 id=david-henrie-3-million><strong>David Henrie ($3 million)</strong></h2><p>Seated on that couch in the year 2030 beside Fonseca for the same timeframe, playing Ted’s future son Luke, Henrie also has a few other projects to his name adding to his wallet, including a role on Wizards of Waverly Place, and starring roles in the films Little Boy and Walt Before Mickey.</p><p>At just 29, he’s already had a ton of guest starring roles on series like NCIS and Judging Amy, and a recurring role on That’s So Raven. You might also recognize him from 2013’s Grown Ups 2. He tried his hand at directing in 2018 with his first film, a coming-of-age flick called This Is the Year, in which he also starred and co-wrote. He has also been cast as a young Ronald Reagan in the upcoming biopic starring Dennis Quaid.<span class=related-single>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=cristin-milioti-2-million><strong>Cristin Milioti ($2 million)</strong></h2><p>It might seem surprising that Milioti, who played the mother, Tracy we finally got to see in the final season, only has a net worth of $2 million. Appearing in a total of 25 episodes, she went on to other series, including A to Z, Fargo, The Mindy Project, The Venture Bros., and No Activity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Entire Cast Of Grey's Anatomy's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Her most notable role since, however, was in <a href=#>an episode of Black Mirror </a>entitled “USS Callister,” where she plays a digital clone stuck in a video game created by a bitter and reclusive coder who forces co-workers to bow down to him in the digital world.</p><h2 id=wayne-brady-10-million><strong>Wayne Brady ($10 million)</strong></h2><p>Wayne Brady was only a recurring character, playing Barney’s gay half-brother. But he appeared in a total of 13 episodes, which is more than many of Ted’s ex-girlfriends. He’s made a lot of <a href=#>dough from his comedy career</a>, including hosting Don’t Forget the Lyrics!&nbsp;and being a regular on improv comedy series Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p><p>He currently hosts Let’s Make a Deal, a gig he’s had since 2009. In addition to making bank from game show hosting, Brady also makes guest appearances on TV series, including The Bold and the Beautiful, had a recurring role on the sci-fi series Colony in 2018 and performed in theatre productions like Kinky Boots on Broadway and Hamilton in Chicago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-williams-3-million><strong>Ashley Williams ($3 million)</strong></h2><p>Of all the girlfriends that Ted had on the show, Victoria, played by Williams, was a fan favorite, and the one that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many viewers though would end up being the mother</a>. Appearing in 16 episodes of the series from 2006-2014, alas, it wasn’t meant to be for Ted and the baker (ironically because of Ted’s feelings for Robin), and they eventually broke up for good.</p><p>Williams, however, went on to continue to make bank, appearing in The Jim Gaffigan Show from 2015-2016, then having guest appearances on a number of TV series and TV movies, the latest being two Christmas movies: Northern Lights of Christmas and Christmas in Evergreen: Letters to Santa.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 TV Shows For People Who Miss How I Met Your Mother</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMomSmnaRixrDB0WakqKyYmr9ur8Csq2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-lacy-storms-off-stage-after-fan-throws-camera-at-him.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Lacy Storms Off Stage After Fan Throws Camera At Him</span></a>
