Netflix released a new trailer this morning showing the lives of Eleven (<a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown</a>) and Will (<a href=#>Noah Schnapp</a>) in school, with a voice-over from Eleven's letter to Mike (Finn Wolfhard). The trailer also showed clues of the action sequences that take place everywhere other than the Upside Down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joyce (<a href=#>Winona Ryder</a>) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) also appear in the trailer, although their new lives seem to be unclear. However, a quick snippet of the new character Argyle (Eduardo Franco) is shown, who will be Jonathan's best friend.</p><p>Other than the season four announcement, this is the fifth trailer Netflix has released to promote the show. The previous trailers have shown season storylines, all of the prominent cast members, and the confirmation that Jim Hopper (David Harbour) is still alive following the season three finale.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Has Interesting Theories Following The Release Of The Latest ‘Stranger Things’ Trailer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=celebrating-strangerthingsday>Celebrating #StrangerThingsDay</h2><p>Shortly after releasing the trailer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stranger Things Twitter account joined the party, and posted a tweet with the hashtag #strangerthingsday in honor of the fun-filled day</a>. Users have responded to the tweet with answers from the Byers house, to wherever Max (<a href=#>Sadie Sink</a>) is. However, most of the tweets have been from fans wanting to see Hopper, and the bromance of Steve (<a href=#>Joe Keery</a>) and Dustin (<a href=#>Gaten Matarazzo</a>).</p><p>Although the show premiered in Jul. 2016, Stranger Things Day takes place on Nov. 6 due to that date being when Will Byers went missing in season one. The character disappearance was the center point of season one, and created the center point of season two. After the renewal for season two, Schnapp quickly became a regular cast member, with his character of Will Byers ranked the third <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most likable Stranger Things character on Screen Rant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Stranger Things’ Fans Think Eleven Looks Like A Mini Joyce In Season 4 Sneak Peek</a></span></p><h2 id=stars-set-to-appear-in-season-four>Stars Set To Appear In Season Four</h2><p>Other than Franco, other actors joining the season four cast include Jamie Campbell Bower, Joseph Quinn, and Brett Gelman, who has been on the show since season two. Notorious Freddy Krueger portrayer Robert Englund will also have a recurring role, but it is unknown how many episodes he will be featured in.</p><p>Season four has been highly anticipated since the season three finale in 2019. Production began in Lithuania in Feb. 2020, before being halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed in Sept. 2020 in Georgia, and was confirmed to have wrapped in Sept. 2021. The season will premiere in 2022, and the entire series is currently available to stream on Netflix.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Millie Bobby Brown Landed The Role Of Eleven On 'Stranger Things'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilnq9dqMGzrc2gnKtlpJ22r7PSZqurmZmhsrN50qGmsKtdpLOnedahmK1lpKR6psTPnpqtZZ%2BqwbS1w55kqJ5dqbWmedSpqqKclWKxsMPNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./medal-hotel-addis-ababa-ethiopia.html><span>←</span><span>Medal hotel, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</span></a>
