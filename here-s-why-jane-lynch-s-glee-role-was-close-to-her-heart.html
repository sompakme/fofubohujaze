She elaborated that even though, as the journalist stated, "nobody in real life is like Sue Sylvester," her inspiration does come from real people and real life.</p><p>As Jane shared, she vibed with the character of Sue because she shared some of the&nbsp;same deeper motivations as her fictional counterpart. And that is part of why she accepted the role and really felt connected to the character. Sure, there were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things that didn't make sense about 'Glee' as a whole</a>, but Sue's character&nbsp;was surprisingly well-developed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Jane told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>&nbsp;"I have a quick temper... Now that I’ve had some therapy I know what this comes from: It’s protecting a soft heart." Sounds a bit like Sue, when fans remember the gym teacher's past.</p><p>Lynch explained that&nbsp;the character's back story, having a&nbsp;sister with Down syndrome, meant that "I [as Sue] took on this militaristic thing when, deep down inside, my heart was breaking for the vulnerability of my sister in this very cruel world."</p><p>Fans can see where Sue's personality alludes to hurt beneath her tough exterior, though as Lynch says, "but it’s a very thin veneer—about as thin as her track suit."</p><p>Like countless other talented actors, getting into the mind of her character is part of what makes Jane so great. But when&nbsp;Slate&nbsp;asked her whether "being Sue Sylvester"&nbsp;informed Sophie Lennon from 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," Jane said, yes, of course!</p><p>After all, Sue is "informed by" Jane Lynch, the actress noted, so of course, some of Jane Lynch will leak into Sophie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an explanation of what&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>&nbsp;calls her "wild career journey," Lynch also said that the reason she connected to her 'Glee' character was the same explanation for why she enjoys being a game show host.</p><p>After all, she likes to nurture people, as kind of a "caretaker," Jane admits. But then again, she also likes it when they leave at the end of an hour and her responsibilities as host and mentor are brought to an end!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Glee' Star Jane Lynch Would Pick This Actor To Play Her In A Biopic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn66vsYylsKebmGKwsLrNnpqtnZRitK2xxGapqKSVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./godzilla-minus-one-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html><span>←</span><span>Godzilla minus One Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</span></a>
