Apparently, Khloe once wanted Rob to have a baby with her best friend Malika despite having no romantic involvement.</p><p>Despite being off of social media and reality television for years, Rob surprisingly graced the premiere of The Kardashians through a seldom-seen phone call exchange with his sister, Khloé. The conclusion of the Thursday, May 23, episode tantalized viewers with a glimpse into episode two, showcasing a snippet where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé reached out to her brother with a proposal</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_the-kardashian-jenner-businesses-ranked-from-most-lucrative-to-least_bk_a2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Kardashian-Jenner Businesses, Ranked From Most Lucrative To Least">The Kardashian-Jenner Businesses, Ranked From Most Lucrative To Least</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Reality TV earnings aside, the entire Kardashian-Jenner family earns millions from their many lucrative businesses.</p><h2 id=rob-appeared-on-lsquo-the-kardashians-rsquo-during-a-weird-moment>Rob Appeared On ‘The Kardashians’ During A Weird Moment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-24-at-8-11-52-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Malika [Haqq] wants to have another kid,” Khloe siad on the call to her brother. “Why not get it from you?” Malika is already a mother to her 4-year-old son from her previous relationship with ex O.T. Genasis.</p><p>However, Rob was quick to shut down the idea, saying, “I can’t c** anymore,” which elicited a disgusted look from his sister.</p><p>In subsequent events, Scott Disick was brought up to speed on Malika's aspirations to have another baby, and confronted with the possibility of fathering her child. "I’ve always wanted to bang you," he humorously quipped to Malika, 41, during their phone conversation. "Let’s do it!" Scott already shares three children with his ex Kourtney Kardashian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe may have thought Rob and Malika would’ve been a good match, even just for surrogacy, given their history. Their flirtatious friendship was previously documentary on early seasons of The Kardashians. The pair even admitted to “hooking up” on season one of Khloe & Lamar in 2011, though it didn’t seem to last long. Rob went on to have a daughter, Dream, 6, with Blac Chyna, who he was previously engaged to.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/rob-kardashian.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Rob Kardashian Refuses To Be Filmed For Hulu, But He Isn't Shy About Sharing His Daughter Online">Rob Kardashian Refuses To Be Filmed For Hulu, But He Isn't Shy About Sharing His Daughter Online</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Rob Kardashian likes to fly under the radar, but he's not shy about sharing his daughter Dream with the world.</p><p>“Rob and Malika have this weird chemistry,” Khloé confessed in 2010. “I don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it’s sexual energy, whatever. But now I love messing with them, because either one gets irritated, one gets uncomfortable. Like, I think it’s funny.”</p><h2 id=khloe-made-fans-uncomfortable-with-her-comments-about-rob>Khloe Made Fans Uncomfortable With Her Comments About Rob</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/khloe-kardashian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This wasn’t the only off-putting things Khloe has said about Rob recently. Earlier this month, some fans felt uneasy after the Good American founder <a href=#>reflected on how much her son Tatum looks like Rob</a>, even though the toddler’s father is NBA star Tristan Thompson, who she also shares daughter True, 6, with.</p><p>During a recent interview on the SHE MD podcast, Khloe shared her astonishment at how much her son resembles her brother, Rob. Khloe, who opted for surrogacy to welcome her second child with Tristan, jokingly disclosed her playful skepticism about her son's resemblance to Rob. She even teased about considering requesting a DNA test from the fertility clinic to ensure Rob wasn't involved in the conception of Tatum.</p><p>"My son looks just like my brother," Khloe remarked. "Because he was an IVF baby or a surrogate baby, I was like, 'Rob, have you ever donated sperm somewhere?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In this family, that would not surprise me, but that would be so disgusting," she humorously added.</p><p>However, Khloe divulged that she took extra precautions regarding her son's paternity, revealing that she subjected her ex, Tristan, to three DNA tests, much to his dismay. This cautious approach may have stemmed from Tristan's involvement in fathering a child with another woman, Maralee Nichols, while he was still in a relationship with Khloe.</p><p>Reports says Khloe and Tristan are considering a surrogate to have a third baby together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7bq7EoJ6enF2Xv7DAx56pZqqfl3qprdWeZJuZkq56o7HSrWSfqpmau6V7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-the-creator-of-star-wars-george-lucas-earns-his-billions.html><span>←</span><span>How The Creator Of Star Wars, George Lucas, Earns His Billions</span></a>
