Khloe convinced Lamar to check into a San Diego rehab facility last August, but he only lasted three weeks before leaving. He apparently stayed clean during his 2012-2013 season with the Clippers, but relapsed “into hardcore recreational drugs” post-season.</p><p>Khloe reportedly believes Lamar was not faithful but was more intent on saving his life. According to TMZ, Odom’s family staged an intervention with the intention of having Lamar return to rehab. The intervention failed and Khloe kicked him out of the house. Photos of him packing up and leaving his home soon <a href=# rel=nofollow>surfaced</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C1rbvEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkpKGToMBuuMCmmKtln5m8rnnOrqtmoJ%2BqwKZ5wJ%2Brnqpdm66quMSdZJ2qpZx6qrrTnqmvnZ6ptrC6jGpub2lhbnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-johnson-mlb-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Johnson (MLB) Net Worth</span></a>
