She initially thought about it while she was doing her MBA at the<a href=#> prestigious Harvard Business School</a>. She was among the handful students who got into the HBS MBA class of 2011 who went on to start their own business.</p><p>The idea prospered after Arum talked about it with her twin sister Dawoon and older sister Soo. The trio were born to be entrepreneurs, after all entrepreneurship runs in their blood since their parents started their own business in Korea.</p><p>Hailing from South Korea, the Kang sisters came from a family of entrepreneurs. Both of their parents started their own business with their father running his own scrap iron business while their mother went to manage several bars and restaurants.</p><p>The sisters emigrated to the US when they were only 12 years old with their older sister Soo.

She came up with the idea after she noticed that dating and meeting people is extremely hard especially for women. The sisters were keen on making the app a success since they wanted to be of service to women who just wanted to date.</p><p>In order to finally launch the app, the sisters needed to quit their job. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawoon quit her job at the JPMorgan</a>, older sister Soo quit her job as graphic designer for the luxury brands like Sally Hansen and Marc Jacobs while Arum just graduated.

Over the years, the sisters realized that men and women have different styles in terms of dating. Dawoon initially took on the role of Chief Operating Office, but later became the company's Chief Executive Officer four years after Coffee Meets Bagel's inception. Soo on the other hand took over as the Head of Design .</p><p>What sets their dating app apart from other dating app is that instead of showing the candidates <a href=#>unlimited number of matches</a>, they curate the system to display just 6 matches for women everyday.</p><h2 id=appearing-on-shark-tank-to-raise-additional-capital>Appearing On Shark Tank To Raise Additional Capital</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kang sisters Dawoon, Arum and Soo went to pitch their business on Shark Tank in 2015. They were seeking for $500,000 investment in exchange for 4% equity on their business. The sisters came on strong to the show and were very pleasant during their presentation.</p><p>They focused their pitch entirely on <a href=#>the benefits of the dating app</a>, leaving no room for background exposition. The entire pitch was used to hype their product and explain what makes them different noting on their core beliefs. No sob story about their personal hardship whatsoever which made their appearance on the show more pleasant.</p><p>Since the sisters were firm on their mission to help others rather than profiting on their business, Mark Cuban decided to challenge this and offered them $30 million in exchange for the company. Coffee Meets Bagel&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received the highest offer </a>a shark gave on the show, but they turned him down.</p><p>None of the sharks ended up investing in the ir company and that's okay. Coffee Meets Bagels increased their popularity and eventually earned millions in investments. After leaving Shark Tank with no luck, the sisters secured over $23 million in five rounds of investments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, the company has reported a total of 10 million users across the world.
