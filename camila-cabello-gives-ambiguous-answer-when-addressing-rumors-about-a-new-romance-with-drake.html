About Drake specifically, she said "I love that man. I love him... We all love him."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camila Cabello skillfully avoided having to share anything specific about the rumors, instead saying <strong>"Have I ever had what? Like, a beautiful, artistic collaboration with him? I may or may not have."</strong></p><p>About how she got in touch with Drake she said that she impulsively DM'd him, asking if he'd like to hear her upcoming album, and the rapper said yes. <strong>"We hung out, I played him my album, he loved it — and I thought that he would, and I was, like, so excited.</strong> It was also just such a surreal moment also for me to, like, play Drake my songs... It's a dream."</p><h2 id=love-will-be-an-important-topic-in-camila-39-s-new-album>Love Will Be An Important Topic In Camila's New Album</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/camila-cabello-loreal-paris-women-of-worth-celebration.jpg><p>The new album she had Drake listen to, and that led to the friendship that's sparked so many rumors recently, will be heavily focused on love, both romantic love and love in general.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camila Cabello recently spoke candidly</a> about how she'd been having a hard time getting over her breakup with Shawn Mendes.</strong> The former couple were best friends, then got together, then split up, then briefly reconnected, and are now truly and completely over.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Shawn-Mendes-and-Camila-Cabello.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Shawn Mendes Thinks Getting Back Together With Camila Cabello Was 'A Mistake'">Why Shawn Mendes Thinks Getting Back Together With Camila Cabello Was 'A Mistake'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello reunited during Coachella 2023, but now Shawn is saying that was probably a mistake...</p><p>Camila knows it was the right choice, but <a href=#>that doesn't mean it was easy</a>. In that sense, <strong>her new album is "me sitting with this feeling of understanding that I feel really confused as a 26-year-old who I really felt I was in love with this person.</strong> Now I feel kind of lonely and small and weird, but at the same time, I’m an adult and I feel so strong in other areas of my life, but not this one."</p><p>Her new music will surely help her work through those conflicting feelings, and whether or not there's something going on between her and Drake, the fact that she wanted his feedback in the process speaks to the strength of their bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqWZoa5ur8CbnKWkn2K0qsLErGSapZKetLa71KxkmqajrLKzedahnKdlkZmxs7HSrKCnn12nwq670axkmpqfqsFuusSwZKunnZa7pLGMnamao5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-look-nothing-like-they-used-to.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Look Nothing Like They Used To</span></a>
