It’s very easy to be self-deprecating in order for people not to see you hurt. So often, she’s like, ‘If I’m self-deprecating, or if I’m making fun of you, or if I lead with my sexuality, then maybe you won’t see through me.’ I knew that something more was going on with Jasmine.”</strong></p><p>Garcia had been hoping to play someone like herself on-screen since she made the move to Los Angeles and resonated with many plot points that made Jasmine a fan favorite.</p><p>Garcia pushed for a full-season storyline for the character, sensing there was more to Jasmine Flores than being a crude and overtly s*xual young woman.</p><p>The actress won her first Teen Choice Award for the role in 2019.</p><p>Garcia has also been seen in How To Get Away With Murder and Diary of a Future President.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>On Health Issues And Confidence</strong></h2><p>In 2013, Garcia was given the scary <a href=#>news</a> that she was pre-diabetic and needed to make significant lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from taking over her body completely.</p><p><strong>“I’ve been overweight my whole life,” </strong>the actress told Glamour, <strong>“being from Cuba, a communist country, my mother came to Florida having never seen an apple. She was so thrilled to be able to give me the world here in the U.S. and one of those things in Latin culture is food.”</strong></p><p>Garcia is nothing but proud of her heritage but accepts that it had an adverse effect on her physical health over the years.</p><p><strong>“As my mom fed me out of love, I was getting bigger and bigger. She never had a weight problem so her eating habits hadn’t affected her, and here I was a five-year-old that just ballooned. When I was old enough to understand what my diet was doing to my health and body, it was too sensitive an issue for me to fix. If anyone dared to tell me to watch what I ate, I’d get defensive and eat more. It was a tough cycle,”</strong> she added.</p><p>Following the health scare, Garcia revealed she had lost over 70 points from small dietary changes and hopes to remain healthy enough not to let diabetes get to her in the future.</p><p>While she acknowledges that much of her fans’ support comes from her openness about being body positive, Garcia has warned followers about the dangers of not taking care of their bodies.</p><p>She has expressed hope that other people in her situation will take the necessary steps to look after their physical and mental wellbeing as she did.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Marriage and Pregnancy</strong></h2><p>Garcia shared the news that she was engaged in January 2016 and married actor Adam Celorier two years later.</p><p>At the time, Garcia shared details of her wedding on her Instagram story, posting photos of the decor and dress for her followers to see.</p><p>The On My Block star routinely expresses her love for her husband on social media,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“You’ve shown me what it is to be truly supported and loved in every way. You’ve always stood by my side and been the partner I didn’t know existed but always prayed for,”</strong> she once shared on social media.<strong> “I love you more than anything and everything. There’s no one else I’d want to go on this wild ride with.”</strong></p><p>On November 12, 2021, Garcia released the first photos of her baby bump, revealing:</p><p><strong>“I’m going to be a mommy! Feels so good to finally tell the world our beautiful little secret,” </strong>Garcia gushed.<strong> “My husband Adam and I are expecting our first child in February of 2022!”</strong></p><p>The couple is expected to share photos of their baby in February 2022.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2xKyqopuRYrqivsieZKCZopi2onnSoZirnaNivam706hknrCTocK0tdWeZJuZkq56tLTOsJyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-tyra-banks-secretly-a-very-strict-mother-to-york-banks-asla.html><span>←</span><span>Is Tyra Banks Secretly A Very Strict Mother To York Banks Asla?</span></a>
