Wonder got a little help from Pharrell at the top of the number after missing his cue, but eventually warmed up. The group opened up the performance with a live band sans the robots in a pseudo recording studio setting. Daft Punk would later reveal themselves from behind the production boards. “Get Lucky” got a the remix treatment with Pharrell dropping in bits of Chic’s “Le Freak” and Daft Punk mixing in their other famous hit “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.</a>” The medley would end with Stevie Wonder breaking out into his Songs in the Key of Life track “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Another Star</a>.”</p><p><a href=#>Read More: VIBE Summer 2013 Cover: Pharrell And Daft Punk</a></p><p>The best thing about the performance might have been the crowds reaction. Everyone from Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler to Beyonce to Katy Perry to Yoko Ono got up on their feet and danced during the performance.
