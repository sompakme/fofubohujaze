But during a new episode of The Kardashians, Khloe admits Tristan overstayed his welcome.</p><p>“It's been three weeks that he’ll be [living] at my house. He was supposed to be there two,” Khloe told the camera during the Hulu’s shows fourth season premiere. “I'll give him until a month before I say something."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Stuns In Rare Chanel Choker Previously Worn By Margot Robbie In 'Barbie' Movie</a></span></p><p>It was first <a href=#>reported in July that Tristan was moving in with Khloe</a> alongside his disabled, younger brother, Amari, whom he was awarded full custody of following his mother’s death earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Tristan has a house that he is doing construction on and renovating,” Khloe explained on The Kardashians at the time. “He was able to live there during renovations but we had crazy weather for California, like extreme rain. Tristan’s roof caved in on his home and caused flooding.”</p><p>“So Tristan and Amari are staying at my house now until his home gets fixed,” she went on.</p><p>However, given Khloe’s recent statements, it appears Tristan may be getting too comfortable living under Khloe’s roof after so many months.</p><p>Khloe and Tristan have been on-and-off for years, but they split for the final time in January 2022, when it was revealed Tristan fathered a baby with another woman while in a relationship with Khloe. They were expecting a second child via surrogate at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the first time Tristan and Khloe have stayed at each other’s places for long durations despite not being together. In 2020, when Khloe’s home was under construction, Tristan offered to let her and their daughter True stay in his Los Angeles home while he was mainly in Cleveland playing basketball.</p><p>"I have my house in L.A.," Tristan said at the time during a Keeping Up With The Kardashians episode. "I'd love for you and True to stay there as long as you guys need to. I'll give you guys the keys and you can go party on — you, True and whoever else."</p><p>Tristan added that Khloe and True were welcome to stay at his place even when he returned to LA, adding he’d find somewhere else to stay in the meantime, though Khloe protested his offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe didn’t provide insight into how she plans to get Tristan out of her home right now, but the <a href=#>reality star is building side-by-side mansion with her mom</a> Kris Jenner, so it looks like it won’t be long until Khloe is moving on to bigger and better things.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpKCcpLJut8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nCmqWtZZeawW7A0aKqrZmeYsGpu8ypqqimXaK8t7GMqKytZZiav265wKeqoqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ivanka-trump-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-more.html><span>←</span><span>Ivanka Trump Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
