Of course, there’s been a lot of attention around his music as well, given that <strong>the rapper has nine Grammy nominations so far</strong>. Unfortunately, Scott has yet to win one.</p><p>Undeniably, however, Travis Scott’s popularity soared after he became romantically linked with reality star <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> in 2017.</p><p>Scott and Jenner became parents, <a href=#>welcoming daughter Stormi in 2018</a>. They went on to welcome their son, Aire, in 2022.

But how has the notoriety impacted his net worth?</p><p><strong>Updated November 2023:</strong> Travis Scott's lawsuits are slowly beginning to be settled. While it is presumed that many of them will be settled without any fanfare in the news, so far, three have made the press. All are for those who passed away at the event and their family filed a civil lawsuit on their behalf. The terms of the settlements are not being disclosed, and there is a gag order on families being able to discuss anything with the press. As such, it is highly likely that the actual terms of settlement victims and families receive will never be known.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-travis-scott-being-sued-for>How Much Is Travis Scott Being Sued For?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52748614-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The incident at the Astroworld Festival <strong>is said to be one of the deadliest crowd-control events in recent years</strong>. The two-day event kicked off with a concert that drew in an estimated 50,000 people.</p><p>Then, without warning, a crowd surge occurred. According to ABC News, Houston Fire Chief Sam Peña said that the crowd “began to compress toward the front of the stage.”</p><p>When Scott’s set started, concertgoers could reportedly be seen in “distress” less than minutes after the show started. Nonetheless, Scott kept going, although he did try to get help for someone “passed out” in the crowd at one point.</p><p>Later on, several more of the crowd were injured as the surge continued. Soon, the police decided to officially declare the festival as a mass casualty event.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Scott Is Going On A World Tour As He Faces $10 Billion In Lawsuits From Astroworld Tragedy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Days after the Astroworld incident, the death toll from the event had gone up to 10. <a href=#>One of the victims was nine-year-old Ezra Blount</a> who died after being placed in a medically induced coma.</p><p>Following the deaths and the injuries, Scott has been named in multiple lawsuits. One was brought forth by Houston law firm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brent Coon & Associates is demanding $10 billion</a>. The firm currently represents 1,547 concertgoers.</p><p>Meanwhile, personal injury law firm Thomas J. Henry Law, PLLC has filed a $2 billion lawsuit against Scott, Apple Music, and others associated with the event on behalf of the victims.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Buzbee Law Firm has also filed a lawsuit on behalf of several families to the tune of $750 million.</a></p><p>Overall, it is believed that <strong>more than 140 lawsuits have already been filed against Scott</strong>. The rapper has been trying to get the charges dismissed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=astroworld-39-s-effects-on-travis-scott-39-s-net-worth>Astroworld's Effects On Travis Scott's Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52749057-1.jpg><p>Scott’s primary earnings may be coming from his music sales, but the rapper has also been raking in millions from endorsement deals and partnerships over the years.</p><p>For instance, Scott has a deal with Nike that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly earns him around $10 million a year, according to Forbes</a>. The rapper also has partnerships with PlayStation and Fortnite that pay him millions.</p><p>Scott also struck a deal with McDonald’s, leading to the launch of his very own Travis Scott meal. From this partnership, the rapper collects twice. There’s the traditional endorsement part that reportedly pays Scott $5 million and then, there are the merchandise sales deals that earn an additional $15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Scott's Air Jordan 1's And Black Phantoms Are Extremely Expensive For These Reasons</a></span></p><p>It’s no wonder that the rapper’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is already estimated at $80 million</a>. Following the Astroworld incident, however, <strong>it seems that Scott would have a tough time closing more multi-million dollar deals</strong>. In fact, it seems that his future with some partners is rather uncertain at the moment.</p><p>For starters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike has decided to put the launch of its shoe collaboration with Scott on hold in the wake of the tragedy</a>. However, in 2023, Scott debuted his new sneaker collaboration at Cannes.</p><p>"Out of respect for everyone impacted by the tragic events at the Astroworld Festival, we are postponing the launch of the Air Max 1 x Cactus Jack,"</p><p>a spokesperson for Nike said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortnite has stopped the sale of the rapper’s Out West emote on its item shop.</p><p><strong>As for McDonald’s, once the contract with Scott ran out in 2020, the corporation chose to no longer work with the rapper.</strong></p><p>At the same time, Scott has also faced backlash after deciding to partner with BetterHelp following the tragedy. “Travis Scott's team reached out to us with an initiative to cover the cost of therapy for those who were impacted,” the company’s statement read.</p><p>“Due to the sensitive nature of this tragic event, we wanted to provide more clarification on how BetterHelp’s support will be delivered through this initiative.” And while the company made it clear that Scott wasn’t getting any money from their initiative, many slammed it as a tasteless PR move.</p><p>The Astroworld Festival tragedy has also reportedly affected Scott’s time in reality television. It is believed he was supposed to make an appearance in the Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those plans, however, were scrapped. "Cameras have been rolling for months,” one source told Radar.</p><p>"However, after the disaster at the concert, where Kylie and Kendall were both backstage, footage of Travis is being edited out of the show."</p><p>This proved to be true as at no time, did Scott appear on the show with the Kardashian clan.</p><h2 id=how-much-travis-scott-has-paid-to-date-to-settle-lawsuits-from-astroworld>How Much Travis Scott Has Paid To Date To Settle Lawsuits From Astroworld</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar51544890-1.jpg><p>Since the lawsuits began to come in, people have been waiting to either take Scott to court or to settle for what they believe to be a fair compensation for either suffering injuries or losing a loved one. Those lawsuits are slowly starting to be settled, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with the first one being settled in October 2022</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Axel Acosta was the first victim to have the civil case settled. He was 21 years old when he attended Astroworld. He died at the event as a result of being crushed and asphyxia.</p><p>The terms of the settlement were not disclosed but LiveNation will be paying the compensation to Acosta's family.</p><p>More recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a settlement was made for 14-year-old John Hilgert</a>, who also passed at the event. Again, the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. However, <strong>none of the money to be paid is coming out of Scott's pocket.</strong></p><p>Source: ABC News, Forbes, Radar, BetterHelp</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBuv8Koq61lnprBbsPOq6uhZZGowbO71qippZxdmLyvwNGorZ6qo658</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-spy-on-your-competitors-google-ads-campaigns.html><span>←</span><span>How to Spy on Your Competitors Google Ads Campaigns</span></a>
