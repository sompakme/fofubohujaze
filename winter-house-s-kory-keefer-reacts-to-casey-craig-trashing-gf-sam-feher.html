Kory is clued in by his <a href=#>Summer House</a> pal <a href=#><strong>Kyle Cooke</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kory-Keefer-Reacts-to-Winter-House-s-Casey-Craig-Calling-His-GF-Sam-Feher-Trash-That-s-F%E2%80%93ked-Up-003.jpg><p>“She just kinda kept on saying Sam is trash,” Kyle, 41, reveals in the clip, while a stunned Kory responds, “She said that?”</p><p>Kyle confesses, “It definitely had mean girl from high school vibes.” The remark stings for Kory, who replies, “That’s f–ked up.”</p><p>While Kory is in awe of what he’s hearing, the clip flashes back to the night before when Kyle and Casey were discussing <a href=#>Kory’s romance</a> with Sam.</p><p>“I’ve never met her, but I have group chats that say she’s trash,” Casey tells Kyle in the kitchen. “Absolute, absolute trash.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kory-Keefer-Reacts-to-Winter-House-s-Casey-Craig-Calling-His-GF-Sam-Feher-Trash-That-s-F%E2%80%93ked-Up-005.jpg><p>Kory and Sam met while <a href=#>filming season 7 of Summer House in 2022</a>. What started as two costars hooking up became a real-deal relationship by spring 2023. However, when Kory went to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to film season 3 of Winter House in March, he was vague about his relationship status.</p><p>“I like her a lot, but we haven’t put a label on it to make it official,” <a href=#>Kory said during the season premiere</a>, which aired in October. “It’s a real gray area where I can have a little more fun. I don’t know how to say that properly without sounding like a douchebag.”</p><p>His inability to define the relationship led to <a href=#>Kory flirting with several of his costars early in the season</a>. Casey, for her part, was rooting for her friend <a href=#><strong>Jordan Emanuel</strong></a> to have a vacation hookup with Kory and therefore started talking trash as sort of a hype woman for Jordan, 31.</p><p>Kory <a href=#>exclusively told Us earlier this month</a> that fans will see Sam come in “very hot … no breaks, all spice” during her cameo on Winter House.</p><p>He also teased that his now-girlfriend was not pleased to see him get cozy with his Bravo costars while she was in New York.</p><p>“There was a little bit of a hate text going back and forth,” Kory told Us on November 3 of Sam’s reaction to his behavior on camera. “But at the end of the day, she knows what actually happened and how it ends. So it was good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite a few bumps along the way, Kory confirmed to Us that he and Sam are no longer just a “situation.” He gushed, “Yes, we are official officials.”</p><p>Winter House airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6ipqSav260zq6qnqtdoLyzxYyknJ6elad6s7HAnKusZaSkeqSt0p6wZpuilraoedOrmKygmaO0brPFZqqapV2bsqmx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willie-spence-death-cause-what-happened-to-american-idol-singer-family-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Willie Spence Death Cause: What Happened To American Idol Singer?
