He’s always worked so hard on his craft and seeing him do all of these things is so awesome and he’s so talented.”</p><p class=p1>Butler went on to date Tisdale’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>High School Musical&nbsp;</i>costar and bestie</a> <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a> for nine years.

I’m like, ‘Hello, it’s your cousin. You can’t ignore me, I’m family.’”</p><p class=p1>Butler, who is<a href=#> currently dating model <strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>, is not typically out of pocket when it comes to Tisdale and Jupiter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“He has always taken the time,&nbsp;which I think is like the most important thing to me, to FaceTime to be a part of her life in ways,” the<i>&nbsp;Suite Life of Zack and Cody</i>&nbsp;alum&nbsp;<a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in March</a>. “He’s always been able to do that, and I think that’s something that has been really sweet. Basically, like, the day after I had her, <a href=#>he was, like, FaceTiming us in the hospital</a>. Even with his crazy schedule, he’s always making the time. And I think that’s just respectable.”</p><p class=p1>Tisdale and <a href=#>her 41-year-old husband,</a> who wed in 2014, <a href=#>welcomed their baby girl</a> in March 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaaraOptq95wa6rpZ2iYsC4tcysZLChpJ16or%2FHpZyyZaSewKWty56qZpyRqrSpwMSrZKOtoJ7Bpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ali-larter-talks-varsity-blues-reveals-if-she-ll-show-her-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Ali Larter Talks 'Varsity Blues,' Reveals If She'll Show Her Kids</span></a>
