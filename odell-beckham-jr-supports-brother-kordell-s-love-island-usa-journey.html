Kordell and Serena initially paired up at the start of the season but faced challenges when Kordell briefly coupled with another contestant, <strong>Daia McGhee</strong>, upon returning from <a href=#>Casa Amor</a>. Despite these twists, Kordell and Serena reunited during a subsequent recoupling, leading to Daia’s departure.</p><p>Before being dumped from the villa, <a href=#>Daia’s social media activity</a> was a hot topic both on and off screen.</p><p>During the July 8 episode of the popular Peacock show, cast members confronted social media comments from outside viewers. In particular, Daia drew attention due to alleged interactions with Odell on social media prior to pursuing Kordell on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Odell-Beckham-Jr-Supports-Brother-Kordells-Love-Island-USA-Journey-03-2024.jpg><p>“I can’t stand Daia especially after seeing those tweets about how she was all in Odell Beckham Jr.’s comments,” a post, read by cast member <strong>Leah Kateb</strong>, stated. “She came to the villa with a plan and Kordell’s dumb ass fell for it throwing all the morals he claimed he was going to have before entering casa.”</p><p>As soon as Leah read the message from an undisclosed viewer, Daia became visibly upset and denied the accusations. Later in confessional, Daia doubled down on her stance, asserting that upon her arrival at Casa Amor, her feelings for Kordell were genuine and independent of his family ties.</p><p>“I genuinely care for Kordell,” she said. “My intentions were always about him, not anything related to his brother. That’s just wild to me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Serena, for her part, clarified her stance amidst the drama, asserting her innocence regarding any involvement with the footballer’s social media. “I know damn sure I wasn’t in his comments,” she affirmed.</p><p>Eagle-eyed fans turned into sleuths, scouring social media for clues. One TikTok user claimed to have found evidence: Daia allegedly left two heart-eyed smiley face emojis on an Instagram post by Odell. However, skepticism arose among other users who suggested the screenshot might have been doctored, citing a blurry heart in the corner as evidence.</p><p>New episodes of Love Island USA drop six days a week at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKadnZyheqOxwqSfmqVdn79uv9Spp6iqpKh6o77OrZ%2Beql2gvLOwxKWjrGWcpMOmeciso5qmlGLCtK2Mo6auqp6axnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./never-have-i-ever-recap-more-than-a-pretty-face.html><span>←</span><span>Never Have I Ever Recap: More Than a Pretty Face</span></a>
