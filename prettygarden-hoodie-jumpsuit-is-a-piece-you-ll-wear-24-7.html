The smaller details are what make this jumpsuit as great as it is. We love the zip-up style that makes it super easy to throw on and show a little extra skin too. If you want to wear it without a top underneath, that’s totally doable, but you can also lower the zipper and wear it with a crop top underneath.</p><p>We also love that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this jumpsuit</a> has an elastic waistband that cinches you in and gives you a more shapely silhouette! Without that elastic, this ensemble would look more like a set of PJs instead of a put-together outfit, which brings Us to how we would style it if we were to wear it out and about.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN Women’s Long Sleeve Zip-up Hoodie Jumpsuit</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> on Amazon!

If it’s warm enough outside you can wear it alone, or if it’s chillier, you can throw on a leather moto jacket or jean jacket to provide an extra layer.
