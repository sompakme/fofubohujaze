According to many sources, including Closer Weekly and Heavy.com, several fans of the HGTV series have thought that they might be husband and wife. People always talk about the way that they joke around onscreen, and they do have a playful way of talking to each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/an-extra-on-love-it-or-list-it-revealed-the-homes-would-look-different-once-they-were-done-shooting.jpg><p>However, they are definitely just pals, and there they have never had a relationship. When fans think that there is something more going on between them, it's likely because they have gotten to know each other so well over the years.

I mean, pick anything and I’m going to tease him about it. One of the things is the Italian hand flap, when his hands and his arms are just flying everywhere, like he’s going to take off at any minute. That’s one of them for sure. The other one is that he’s quite the motor mouth. He really is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the hosts have never dated, people still talk about them and wonder. Even earlier this year, a fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about the HGTV co-stars on Reddit</a> and asked, "Does anyone else feel like they’re in love? It’s that or the editors are messing with us. You cannot convince me otherwise."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hilary-farr-david-visentin.jpg><p>Several fans responded that they are friends and that's it.

He shared that while they weren't super close at the very start of filming the series, that changed and their friendship "manifested over time."</p><p>Visentin said:</p><p>"We’re good friends, we hang out outside of the show. We go out for dinners, talk about the show, talk about life.</p><p>But we’re both fairly competitive. So even outside of the show, we’ve been known to banter and we have to be very careful when we’re in public because sometimes we’ll just start in on each other. What you see on the show is kind of our relationship."</p><p>Farr and Visentin weren't friends before they were hired on Love It Or List It. It doesn't sound like they knew each other at all. Visentin explained to Monsters and Critics that he auditioned when his sister, who had a job at a TV network, suggested that he try out for the series. He called the audition with Farr "fun" but said that she doesn't recall meeting him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hilary-farr-david-visentin-1.jpg><p>Visentin also shared that sometimes, they have had trouble getting along, but those moments aren't included in Love It Or List It episodes.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fixer-to-fabulous.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fixer To Fabulous Might Not Be Entirely Real, Here’s The Truth About The Popular HGTV Series</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>In a sea of home renovation and design shows, Fixer To Fabulous stands out, but how authentic is every episode of the HGTV series?</span><p>He said, "She accuses me of having a runaway mouth that’s like a train that doesn’t stop" and explained that Farr "is the same."</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Hilary Farr's Acting Credits (According to IMDb)</p></th><th scope=col><p>David Visentin's Reality TV Appearances (According to IMDb)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)</p></td><td><p>Celebrity Guest Judge on Brother vs. Brother (2013-2015)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tough Love with Hilary Farr (2021)</p></td><td><p>appeared in the documentary HGTV Insider (2015)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Designing Christmas (2022)</p></td><td><p>appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show (2020)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the co-hosts have shared that they are friends, it makes sense that they would have some conflict sometimes.

She said, "It’s a combination. I love the crew and I love my co-host, David. I’m doing what I love to do. I’ve been able to open the clients eyes, as well as the audiences."</p><p>Visentin seems to love what he does as well. His Instagram bio reads "I am the dashingly handsome host of the hit show Love It or List it!" which suggests that having this job makes him very happy.</p><p>According to People, in a 2022 episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation of Hilary Farr's house was included</a>, which allowed viewers to get to know the co-host even more.
