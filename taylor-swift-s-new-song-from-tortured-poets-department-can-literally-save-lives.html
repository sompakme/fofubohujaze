Who did Swift write each song about?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when Swift released her album "The Tortured Poets Department" in 2024, some people had a very different question. How many lives will Swift help to save? The reason observers had that question is The American Heart Association posted on Instagram about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how "The Tortured Poets Department" can save lives</a></strong>.</p><p>"Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department has 110 beats per minute - the right tempo for Hands-Only CPR."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-shocked-fans-after-revealing-intense-anxiety-around-her-new-music-leaking-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That quote from The AHA's Instagram account was posted as an image.
