Each season, we see new and familiar professionals work with the stars and guide them to dancing immortality. The pros help make the show a spectacle, and over time, fans have developed an affection for many of them.</p><p>With speculation running rampant about season 33, fans have been picking the pros that they would like to see return.</p><h2 id=fans-would-love-to-see-names-like-val-chmerkovskiy-and-witney-carson-return-for-season-33-of-dancing-with-the-stars>Fans Would Love To See Names Like Val Chmerkovskiy And Witney Carson Return For Season 33 Of Dancing With The Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Olivia-Jade-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans dream lists have included some top-tier talent, and a few of the names popped up multiple times.</p><p>One fan made some fantastic picks.</p><p>"Men: Alan, Val, Pasha, Ezra, D'Angelo, Maks, Brandon and fill the rest with brand new men/past DWTS pros who want to come back.</p><p>"Women: The same, but add Lindsay and a new pro since Peta probably won't be back this season. I would love to see Karina as well," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they wrote for their ideal lineup</a>.</p><p>It's not too surprising to see Val's name come up so quickly. The man is as beloved as it gets on the show, and most importantly, he loves what he does.</p><p>The multi-time champ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was interviewed by ScreenRant</a>, and he talked about both winning, and getting so close to the Mirror Ball.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Both times I thought I had a great chance of winning, but there were times when I lost that I thought I had a great chance at winning too. I have, I call it, delusional optimism or blind confidence, especially when it comes to any sort of competition. I believe in myself, and I believe in my partner. I believe in our team. Believe it or not, I had that type of confidence when I was eliminated third, and I had that confidence when I ended up winning. I have that confidence this season yet again," he said in 2022.</p><ul><li>Another user gave some solid names, as well, being more specific with their female selections:</li><li>"Ideal Line Up —Witney Dani Britt Alexis Lindsay Rylee Emma Karina. Val Artem Ezra Pasha D’Angelo Tony Brandon Gleb," they wrote.</li></ul><p>Witney Carson is a notable pick here, as she has not been a pro on the show since season 31. Despite this, she has an excellent track record on the show, and has done well for herself.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">In an interview</a>, Carson talked about a potential return to Dancing with the Stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Yes, I’m definitely open to it. I’m not a yes and I’m not a no. I’m kind of like in-between where I could be swayed one or the other. It just really depends on where our life is in the moment. The show is 'always calling my name. I love it so, so much. No matter how many times I do it, I always want to go back. So, it’s not a no and it’s not a yes. So, we’ll see. I know that’s not the answer you want, but…'" she said.</p><p>Though fans would like Carson back, one fan believes that a return is unlikely, now that she is focused on her family.</p><p>"I really can't see Witney returning. Her life seems very full with her new brand deals right now. Her family seems very happy, settled and thriving in Florida. Constant travel to and from LA would be a huge undertaking, as would uprooting the family for the season," they wrote.</p><p>Both Val and Witney would be exceptional pros to have on board for season 33 of the show, and fans would be more than happy to have them included.</p><p>A few other notable pros that received mention were D'Angelo Castro, Karina Smirnoff, and a few others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though no pros have been announced just yet, fans can be happy knowing that some big names are returning to host the show once more.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/okok.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cheryl Burke's Brutal Body Dysmorphia During Dancing With The Stars Isn't The Only Time Her Health Has Suffered ">Cheryl Burke's Brutal Body Dysmorphia During Dancing With The Stars Isn't The Only Time Her Health Has Suffered</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Chery Burke struggled with some distressing health issues beyond the body dysmorphia that she faced when she competed on Dancing With The Stars.</p><h2 id=it-has-been-confirmed-that-julianne-hough-and-alfonso-ribeiro-will-be-returning-to-host-season-33-and-that-all-three-judges-are-coming-back>It Has Been Confirmed That Julianne Hough And Alfonso Ribeiro Will Be Returning To Host Season 33, And That All Three Judges Are Coming Back</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52680660.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">According to Parade</a>, both Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough will be returning to host the popular show. The duo took over during season 32 following the departure of Tyra Banks.</p><p>The network confirmed that all three judges from last season, Derek Hough, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli will all be back in their roles, as well.</p><p>The three judges from season 32 all did an admirable job following the tragic passing of legendary judge, Len Goodman.</p><p>It's also been confirmed that the show will continue airing on Disney+ and ABC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's a privilege for Dancing with the Stars to become the first live series simulcast on ABC and Disney+. This demonstrates the belief that ABC and Disney have always shown in our iconic format and how it’s become a pop-culture powerhouse with millions of fans. We’re thrilled to embark on this new phase in our partnership which has been going strong for nearly two decades," Valerie Bruce of BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions stated.</p><p>Right now, those are the only confirmations for the show.

I’m not the best person with rhythm, but you never know. Sometimes opportunities arise and it depends if I want to take it on or not. So, I’m just taking it day by day and we’ll see, whatever opportunities come up, we’ll see if I want to go through with it," she said.</p><p>It would not be too far-fetched for the show, who did have Carole Baskin of Tiger King fame as a contestant during season 29.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_dancing-with-the-stars-pro-rylee-arnold-wants-to-use-the-show-to-meet-robert-irwin-since-she-thinks-he-is-the-cutest-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Dancing With The Stars' Pro Rylee Arnold Wants To Use The Show To Meet Robert Irwin After He Was Called 'The Cutest">Dancing With The Stars' Pro Rylee Arnold Wants To Use The Show To Meet Robert Irwin After He Was Called 'The Cutest</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Dancing With the Stars' pro Rylee Arnold wants to perform with Robert Irwin because she thinks he's "the cutest".</p><p>With some time to go, it will be interesting to see who makes their way onto season 33 of Dancing With The Stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsKyjYr2zu9Jmqa6ln6eypXnRnquuqp6oeqe70WaqnpmjpLtuf5Jo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./almost-famous-cast-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>Almost Famous Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
