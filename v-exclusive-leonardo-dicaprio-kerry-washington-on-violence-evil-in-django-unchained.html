We’ve uncovered outtakes from their conversation with writer Erik Parker, where Leo and Kerry both talk about the violence and evil in the film.</p><p>“Immediately, I remember that first meeting,” Dicaprio tells VIBE about agreeing to portray slave owner Calvin Candie in the film.&nbsp;“[Co-star] Sam Jackson&nbsp;was like, “You can’t pull any punches, none of this can be sugar coated.” He felt that a lot of this stuff had not been portrayed accurately. And I’d say,&nbsp;even&nbsp;though&nbsp;this is a very isolated story about one man who defies the odds as a slave, how realistic that would have been at that time period. To him, it was about really showing for the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time the&nbsp;horrific&nbsp;atrocities of that time&nbsp;period, that haven’t&nbsp;really&nbsp;been shown of that time period. He told me, “If you are going to do this, you have to go all the way. Therefore more people are going to embrace it for being&nbsp;accurate.”</p><p>Washington resonated Dicaprio’s thought. She agreed that in order to give the movie and her character the most realistic depiction it would involve an austere commitment.</p><p>“There were days where I would think okay, our job.” Washington told VIBE about the violence and the evil in Django Unchained.&nbsp;“Particularly with&nbsp;characters like Leo’s and mine, our job is to have things be as horrible as possible. If we aren’t willing&nbsp;to go&nbsp;there,&nbsp;Jamie’s&nbsp;heroic journey [as Django]&nbsp;means less. This is a story about a man who comes up from the depths of hell, from the&nbsp;worst of the worst, to rescue his woman. We have to be willing to portray and embody, and be in the worst of the worst.”</p><p>Whether that “worst” involves violence or the use of the N-word is the fine line between storytelling and reality that Django Unchained plays with and leaves up to the audience to decide. And it appears, that if year-end film lists are any indication, the audience has decided that having the actors go all the way paid off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6t6psTCpaysoaaaeq2xzqeYq5yfYrGqr8CpqaKnXaCys77YZq6aq5ieu6jAzqdkr6GfobKvr8RmnK%2BhnGKxq63NoKZmrZ6YtaK1zZ6bZmlibIZ1go4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taraji-p-henson-joins-abbott-elementary-as-janine-s-mother.html><span>←</span><span>Taraji P.
