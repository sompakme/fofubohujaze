Unfortunately, the Friends star realized his mistake far too late—after his memoir was already published.

So why did Matthew diss Keanu, and what happened afterward?</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-39-s-memoir-dished-tons-of-hollywood-gossip>Matthew Perry's Memoir Dished Tons Of Hollywood Gossip</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/matthew-perry-reading-papers-in-new-york.jpg><p>In his memoir, <a href=#>which many labeled shocking</a>, Matthew Perry name-dropped a ton of celebrities. Keanu was one of them, and it wasn't a positive vibe at all. But it wasn't just Keanu that was gossiped about.</p><p>Matthew wrote about his broken relationship with Julia Roberts, who he says he dumped because she was a bigger star and that played on his insecurities. Though <a href=#>he claimed to have broken Julia's heart</a>, Matthew also wrote about how he had a heavy makeout session with another star—one that was married at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Are The Most Iconic Performances Of Keanu Reeves">These Are The Most Iconic Performances Of Keanu Reeves</a></span></p><p>Perry claimed that he made out with Valerie Bertinelli while her then-husband was in the same room. Though Valerie herself didn't explicitly spell out what happened between them, she did take to TikTok to participate in the trend that uses the voiceover "hi, it's me, I'm the problem."</p><p>Bertinelli elaborated that she had misbehaved in her earlier years, which seemed to corroborate Perry's story.</p><p>He didn't stop there, though, dragging Keanu multiple times in his memoir for seemingly no reason.</p><h2 id=what-did-matthew-perry-say-about-keanu-reeves>What Did Matthew Perry Say About Keanu Reeves?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Perry's memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, came out in 2022 and was a highly anticipated release. For anyone who was obsessed with Friends during the height of Perry's fame (or, those who are still fans now) couldn't wait for juicy insider info.</p><p>What they wound up getting was some interesting backstory but also a few unnecessary digs at Keanu Reeves' success.</p><p>Fans would probably agree that Matthew's career can hardly be compared to Keanu's, if only because Keanu is known for being an all-around great person, while Matthew admits to having hurt a lot of people while he was dealing with personal problems.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Matthew Perry Has Revealed About His Journey With Addiction ">What Matthew Perry Has Revealed About His Journey With Addiction</a></span></p><p>Yet in his book, Matthew wrote things like, "Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another passage referencing the passing of Chris Farley noted, "I punched a hole through Jennifer Aniston’s dressing room wall when I found out. Keanu Reeves walks among us."</p><p>Clearly, Matthew was communicating that he thought Keanu was not only untalented but that something bad should have happened to him instead of people who were Matthew's friends. People who, unfortunately, passed away because of substance issues...</p><p>Fans were not happy about Matthew's comments, though they understood he was hurt over his friends' deaths.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-didn-39-t-get-any-sympathy-from-keanu-fans>Matthew Perry Didn't Get Any Sympathy From Keanu Fans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/keanu-reeves-outside-jimmy-kimmel-live.jpg><p>On Reddit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people discussed Matthew's comments</a> and how out of touch he must be to have made such statements. As one commenter noted, "It’s crazy to think of how insulated he must have been for the last ~15 years or so for him to not realize that this would go over poorly."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An apparently in-tune Redditor wrote, "He hates himself. That’s why he had to push it onto Keanu. Because he’s still making excuses." Perry later stated that he should have 'used his own name' and admitted that his references to Keanu were in poor taste.</p><p>The actor's statement elaborated, "I'm actually a big fan of Keanu. I just chose a random name, my mistake. I apologize. I should have used my own name instead."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Matthew Perry Refuses To Watch Friends Reruns, Here's Why">Matthew Perry Refuses To Watch Friends Reruns, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>It didn't seem random to fans who dissected the quotes and Matthew's response to it. One wrote, "The especially weird part is that he framed the Keanu insult around the death of River Phoenix and made it seem like he and River were great friends or something when in reality Keanu and River were best friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They elaborated, "It's one thing to make a comment like that but it has to be extra biting to frame it around one of his close friends. And if Perry actually knew Phoenix that we'll he would have known he and Keanu were friends."</p><p>Despite all the backlash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew explained that he was "pretty certain" his memoir would help people</a>, given that it dives deep into his experiences with substance abuse and recovery.</p><p>He might have had good intentions, but perhaps an editor or someone else who read the memoir before its release should have cautioned Matthew Perry from putting his foot in his mouth big time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIymmK2smJrEbrzEq6myZaOWxm6twaisrWWbmq6vwYyrnJ6ulah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvin-harrison-net-worth-how-much-is-harrison-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marvin Harrison Net Worth How Much is Harrison Worth?</span></a>
