After the marriage fell apart, the 'Hero' singer offered her ex a $10 million dollar divorce settlement. This pushed Nick’s net worth to new heights.</p><p>With a number of syndicated radio shows, a forthcoming talk show, multiple endorsement deals, contracts with the biggest TV companies, and a senior position over at 'TeenNick', there’s no doubt that this man knows how to make money.</p><p>He now has an estimated net worth of over $50 million. But how exactly was Nick able to build his empire? Well, believe it or not, but most of his money was made through television work - not from his short-lived career as a rapper.</p><h2 id=he-s-produced-many-tv-shows><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He’s Produced Many TV Shows</span></h2><p class=p1>While most people know Nick Cannon due to his impressive acting skills, he’s also a gifted producer. He has produced a range of shows, including The Halo Effect, The Nick Cannon Show, and the insanely popular,&nbsp;Wild ’N Out. It’s fair to assume that all of these producer credits are bringing in a relatively large income for Nick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-the-creator-of-wild-n-out><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He’s The Creator Of Wild 'N Out</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick executive produces&nbsp;Wild ’N Out&nbsp;and he also came up with the show's concept back in 2005, before the show premiered. After a few seasons, the show was canceled, but it made a surprise return when Cannon signed a contract that led to Wild ’N Out's return on MTV2 — one can only imagine how much he earned from the deal.</p><h2 id=he-has-two-nationally-syndicated-radio-shows-on-power-106><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Has Two Nationally-Syndicated Radio Shows On Power 106</span></h2><p class=p1>In December of 2019, it was announced that Nick Cannon would host two nationally-syndicated radio shows on Power 106 - 'Nick Cannon Radio' and 'Nick Cannon Mornings'. Given that both shows are syndicated, the father-of-three has set up another steady stream of income, as long as he follows through with his duties on the radio platform.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celebs Eminem Has Thrown Shade At (That Were NOT Nick Cannon)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-hosted-a-number-of-talent-shows><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Has Hosted A Number Of Talent Shows</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick Cannon is a natural when it comes to hosting. He’s well-known for having hosted Simon Cowell’s America’s Got Talent for a number of seasons, before moving over to The Masked Singer, which, in its first season, became one of the highest-rated shows on NBC. Given the show's popularity, there’s no doubt that Nick can demand an increased salary if he wants to.</p><h2 id=he-s-the-chairman-of-teennick><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He’s The Chairman Of TeenNick</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick Cannon already had ties with Nickelodeon, having previously starred in the series, All That and The Nick Cannon Show. In 2009, the network approached him. He was asked to become the chairman of TeenNick. In this new position, he oversees all content for the channel and also comes up with fresh ideas for new and exciting shows.</p><h2 id=he-s-earned-royalties-from-his-music-career><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He’s Earned Royalties From His Music Career</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick Cannon launched his music career in 2003. Since then, he’s put out two studio albums and produced songs for a number of artists, along with theme songs for shows such as Incredible Crew. Producers are known to make a fortune from sales and royalties, so it’s fair to say that Nick has been making a generous amount from his music career alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-produces-scripted-and-unscripted-shows-for-nbcuniversal><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Produces Scripted And Unscripted Shows For NBCUniversal</span></h2><p class=p1>In 2012, Nick Cannon signed a multi-million dollar 'first-look' deal with NBC, to produce a number of their television shows and develop scripted and unscripted entertainment.</p><p class=p1>NBC Entertainment president Paul Telegdy gushed in a statement: “We are gratified to know that this new agreement will expand our successful working relationship with Nick beyond America’s Got Talent and allow him to further draw on his notable creative instincts.”</p><h2 id=he-s-made-profits-from-his-comedy-tours><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He’s Made Profits From His Comedy Tours</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick Cannon held his first comedy tour in autumn of 2010, kicking things off at the 'Just for Laughs' festival in Montreal. From there, Nick would continue his run by recording his own stand-up comedy special at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. That happened just one year later.</p><p class=p1>It was revealed at the time that tickets for his comedy shows were reasonably-priced and selling out fast, so Nick earned hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cannon’s Car Collection: 20 Things We Just Found Out</a></span></p><h2 id=he-earned-4-5-million-to-judge-america-s-got-talent><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Earned $4.5 Million To Judge 'America’s Got Talent'</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick was making plenty of money as the host of America’s Got Talent. It’s a fairly large sum to pay the host of a TV show. However, since Cannon already had ties with NBC, it wouldn’t be too shocking to assume that the large income he earned for doing the show was because of his strong connection to the network.</p><h2 id=he-owns-several-luxury-properties><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Owns Several Luxury Properties</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick owns a number of luxury properties - most of which are situated in Los Angeles. In the midst of his divorce from Mariah Carey, it was claimed that Mariah quietly sold their $11 million Bel-Air home without his consent.</p><p class=p1>The two later overcame their differences over the sale, but the big amount that the home sold for showed fans that Nick was making a lot of money in Hollywood. Homes in Bel-Air aren't cheap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-a-major-car-collection-worth-millions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Has A Major Car Collection Worth Millions</span></h2><p class=p1>As if his collection of luxury homes isn't enough, Nick also has a stunning assortment of expensive cars. It’s believed that he owns a Ferrari California, Mercedes-Benz G Wagon, Rolls Royce Drophead Coupe, and Mercedes-Benz M Class, and these costly autos just scratch the surface. It goes without saying that, although Nick has a lot of money, he doesn’t flaunt it as much as he could.</p><h2 id=he-reportedly-settled-his-divorce-with-mariah-carey-for-10-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Reportedly Settled His Divorce With Mariah Carey For $10 Million</span></h2><p class=p1>Following their divorce announcement, it was claimed, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, that Mariah and Nick agreed to go their separate ways, and that Mariah paid Nick $10 million as a settlement fee.</p><p class=p1>Apparently, Nick demanded $30 million instead and this caused friction between the pair, who have two children. It’s believed Cannon ended up walking away with $10 million, instead of the higher sum he asked for, but that's a lot of money nonetheless.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem Ignores Nick Cannon And Drops Album Touching On Gun Control</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-produces-hit-records><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Produces Hit Records</span></h2><p class=p1>Nick Cannon has produced a few hits in his music career. His most popular song, 'Gigolo', became a smash hit in North America, along with 2003’s, 'Feelin’ Freaky'. He also penned and produced 'My City', one of the tracks lifted from Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq soundtrack album.

He would follow in the footsteps of Wendy Williams by launching his own TV show, which would cover pop culture, news, and so much more.</p><h2 id=he-makes-plenty-of-money-through-sponsored-posts><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Makes Plenty Of Money Through Sponsored Posts</span></h2><p class=p1>While he’s not a big fan of putting sponsored posts on his social media pages, Nick Cannon could earn an estimated $20,000 for each sponsored post.
