The 19-year-old prodigy turned pro over a year ago without any college soccer experience and now has what has been reported the most affluent deal in NWSL.&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Post, she has a four-year contract with Washington Spirt that is reportedly worth more than $1.1 million.</p><p>Trinity signed her previous contract after being drafted No. 2 in the 2021 NWSL draft, which, included $42,000 in base salary, housing, and bonuses, per The Post.</p><p>The new contract is reportedly more than six times what she was making and is structured as a three-year contract with an option for the fourth.</p><p>Rodman is the youngest player ever drafted into the league at 18 years old, following Sophia Smith, who was drafted at No 1 in 2020 when she was 19. She proved her talent by leading the league in assists and was named the U.S. Young Female Player for 2021.</p><p>Mike Senkowski, director of North American soccer at Octagon and Rodman’s agent, told Sportico, “<strong>The way she performed in her first year allowed us to go to the club and push to get a new deal done.” “And credit to the team: They understood it. They agree they have a generational talent [in Rodman], and they wanted to reward that</strong><strong>,</strong>” he added.</p><p>Trinity told reporters her team was supportive of helping her make the long-term decision. “T<strong>he biggest test was what we had gone through and, knowing this team had my back through everything,”</strong> Rodman said.</p><p>Unfortunately, the contract comes nothing close to what the highest players make in men’s professional soccer. The NWSL has been trying to change that and, after a year of negations, were successful in a first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in the NWSL’s 10-year history.&nbsp;</p><p>Per Yahoo <a href=#>Sports</a>, it runs through 2025 with the introduction of free agency in 2023, a jump in the league’s minimum salary, other increases in player compensation, additional benefits, and the possibility of revenue sharing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-trinity-rodman>Who Is Trinity Rodman?</h2><p>Rodman’s rise in the women’s professional game has been nothing short of meteoric.</p><p>She was committed to playing college soccer with Washington State but decided to forgo her college eligibility and was drafted by the Washington Spirit second overall in 2021, becoming the youngest-ever player to be drafted by the league.</p><p>In her first season, Rodman set the league alight, leading the club to the NWSL title as she scored seven goals and notched a league-leading seven assists.</p><p>On the back of those game-breaking performances, she was named NWSL Rookie of the Year, and U.S. Soccer tabbed her as Young Female Player of the Year, quite the feat for a player without a single senior cap to her name.</p><p>After that stellar debut season, Rodman became the highest-paid player in the league’s history, recently signing a contract extension with Washington for four years and worth up to a reported $1.1 million. NWSL clubs can use the league terms allocation money to pay Rodman above the league salary maximum.</p><p>Rodman was previously featured for U.S. youth national teams. She has nine goals across just seven matches with the United States Under-20 side, fueling the excitement ahead of her debut with the senior side.</p><p>And if her last name sounds familiar, she also happens to be Dennis Rodman’s daughter. Dennis Rodman, who played in the NBA for 14 seasons, won five NBA titles.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDA0aKloqypYr%2BwsMyapWaflanAbrLIq6qtZaWoxK%2FAjJyYqWWZo3q0tMRmmZ6kmZrDpr%2BMnKypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-highest-grossing-gal-gadot-films-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 Highest-Grossing Gal Gadot Films, Ranked</span></a>
