He has rubbed shoulders with some of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest named actors and actresses</a> in the movie industry, such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Robert De Niro, Vin Diesel, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lopez, Clive Owen, and Tommy Lee Jones. Statham has the propensity to play tough and irredeemable characters, but let's take a look at ten of the highest-grossing box office films he has produced to date.</p><h2 id=fast-and-the-furious-7>Fast and The Furious 7</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From its inception, the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and The Furious franchise stood out with a great cast of Hollywood's best</a> cast of actors and actresses, making it a potential goldmine for movie success. The British actor blended with Hollywood's A-list cast of characters like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodrigues, Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, and rapper Ludacris. Before his official cast as Deckard Shaw in Fast and Furious 7, he made a cameo appearance a the end of Fast and Furious six as the one who killed Han and has a burning vengeance to take out the rest of Dom's crew. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The movie was the most successful movie in the franchise to date</a>, grossing $1.5 billion at the global box office.</p><h2 id=the-fate-of-the-furious>The Fate Of The Furious</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming off the heels of a<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> massive achievement with Fast and Furious 7, </a>which exceeded the global box office earnings of Fast and Furious 6, grossing only $788.7 million. The eighth installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fate of The Furious,</a> came in just behind Fast 7 with $1.2 billion in gross global earnings on a $260 million budget. In the movie, Shaw creates a friendship with Toretto and officially becomes a part of the Family after safeguarding his son in the most dangerous (and heartwarming) fight scenes of the movie. It's safe to say that it was the highlight of the entire movie, even in the absence of the late Paul Walker.</p><h2 id=fast-and-furious-presents-hobbs-and-shaw>Fast And Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw</h2><p>The 2019 film release of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw</a> showcased two of the main characters from the last two installments, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). The two must put aside their past differences and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">join forces to stop the transhuman enhanced cyber-soldier, Brixton Lore (Idris Elba)</a>, ​who holds in his possession a lethal biochemical from wiping out half the world's population. The biochemical warfare plot hits close to home for 2019, but it still managed to clock in $760 million at the global box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-expendables>The Expendables</h2><p>If there was ever a movie to commemorate <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all the action movie legends on one screen, it would be The Expendables</a>. The array of fighting characters includes Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, and Terry Crews. Together, they form a dangerous group of mercenaries known as The Expendables, headed by <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone)</a>. Statham's character, Lee Christmas, is a dangerous knife specialist who is commissioned along with the rest of the crew to assassinate a Latin American dictator. But they smell betrayal in the midst and must choose to save their own lives or the lives of the innocent. As the first film of the franchise, there were mixed reviews. Albeit, the movie grossed $268 million at the global box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-expendables-2>The Expendables 2</h2><p>Two years later, after making a statement as one of the most action-packed fusion films of all time, the second franchise made its debut in 2012 with The Expendables 2. The second film saw much of the same cast of characters keeping their same roles, with the addition of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean Claude Van Damme</a> and Chuck Norris. Jason Statham's character, Lee Christmas, keeps his role as Ross's right-hand man as the entire team goes on a quest for vengeance following the death of one of their comrades. The Expendables 2 earned even higher than the first franchise, grossing a total of $311.9 million at the global box office and making it the highest-earning franchise out of all three movies.</p><h2 id=the-expendables-3>The Expendables 3</h2><p>The third installment of <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Expendables trilogy</a> had an even thicker plot than the previous two, as well as a few new faces that were added to the cast of characters, namely Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson, Ronda Rousey, Victor Ortiz, and Kellan Lutz. Besides that, many of the other characters were familiar faces. The storyline centers around notorious arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who Ross (Sylvester Stallone) was supposed to have killed. However, he's back as the element of surprise with his scope zeroed in on The Expendables. Despite the success of the prior two films, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Expendables 3 grossed the least </a>at the global box office with $209 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spy>Spy</h2><p>Jason Statham has mastered the art of action films as these are virtually the only films he has even really done. Even if there is a hint of romance in a film involving Statham, you can count on an intense adrenaline-pumping scene entwined somewhere in the mix. However, he may have ventured slightly into a different movie genre in the<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2015 action/comedy Spy</a>. The movie's director, Paul Feig, stated that he has been a fan of Statham's and noticed how humor could be found in his persona. When writing Spy, he knew Statham would be the right fit. Starring alongside<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Melissa McCarthy</a> and Jude Law, Spy raked in $233 million worldwide. Not bad for the British actor's first-time action/comedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Hollywood Actors Who Are Also Certified Martial Artists</a></span></p><h2 id=mechanic-resurrection>Mechanic: Resurrection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All Jason Statham fans can agree that he was made for action films. Could you really picture him in a cheesy romance film? Think again. However, that doesn't mean Statham doesn't get the girl in his movies. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the Mechanic: Ressurection</a>, he plays Arthur Bishop, an elite hitman who seeks to leave his murderous past behind him. But when his second half,<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Gina (Jessica Alba),</a> is kidnapped by his old rival, Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine), he is forced to put a hit on some shady characters. The film is highly entertaining, with Statham on display doing a range of breathtaking stunts all on his own. Mechanic: Resurrection grossed $125.7 million at the worldwide box office, exceeding the original Mechanic film, which did $76.3 million.</p><h2 id=transporter-3>Transporter 3</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the most beloved and action-packed movies is the Transporter franchise. While he is not known for being a car fanatic and much as he is <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">known for his incredible martial arts ability</a>, Jason Statham managed to pull off the role of a professional driver for hire quite successfully. From the first Transporter in 2002, which grossed $43.9 million, to Transporter 2, which grossed $88.9 million, to Transporter 3 grossing $109 million at the global box office; <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film only got better with every installment!</a> Undoubtedly, these movies are part of the highlight of Statham's movie career and definitely cemented him as an A-list actor.</p><h2 id=wrath-of-man>Wrath of Man</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrath of Man hit the big screen on May 7th, 2021</a>, making it Jason Statham's most recent film. It's everything you would expect in a film with Statham: hardcore, bloody, explosive, and unpredictable. He plays the part of Patrick Hill, a new entry armor guard at Fortico Security, whose past is a mystery to all his colleagues. He quickly becomes a person of scrutiny when he handles an attempted robbery with ease and efficiency. It turns out that Hill's son was killed in an armor truck robbery some years back, and he is using his job to pinpoint the mean who killed his son. One of the robbers is <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rapper Post Malone</a> who also features in the film. The film grossed a total of $104 million at the global box office and reaffirmed Statham's place as an action star.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Scarlett Johansson Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TributeMovies</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numbers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Film Jabber</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGR%2BcXnHop6hnaOpeqi%2BzqyqoqaXYreiv86nZKyskam1ormMpqavoZWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whitney-port-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Whitney Port Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
