They called it quits in 2002 after three years of dating amid reports of infidelity. “Cry Me a River” also seemed to suggest a cheating scandal, with Timberlake hiring a Spears lookalike to costar in the music video.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>After its premiere in 2002, Spears told Rolling Stone that Timberlake warned her he was releasing a “controversial” video.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“He got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally,” she told the outlet at the time. “But that was a great way to sell the record. He’s smart.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Prior to her book’s October 24 release, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Spears admits to <a href=#>making out with choreographer <strong>Wade Robson </strong></a>while dating Timberlake&nbsp;in The Woman in Me. She writes that the pair “agreed to move past” the infidelity given the years that she was “loyal to Justin” and “only had eyes for him.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>However, Spears also says that Timberlake <a href=#>cheated on her “a couple of times”</a> throughout their relationship. In one instance, Spears alleges that the Grammy winner was photographed with “one of the girls from All Saints” while out in London in 2000. At a later date, she says he allegedly bragged to one of Spears’ dancers about a girl he hooked up with the night before in Las Vegas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Justin-Timberlake-and-Britney-Spears-Cheating-Claims-in-Their-Own-Words-516.jpg><p class=x_elementToProof>Over the years, Timberlake has raised eyebrows on multiple occasions for his commentary on Spears. During a 2003 appearance on 20/20,<a href=#> Barbara Walters</a> asked Timberlake whether Spears had “kept her promise to wait [to have sex] until marriage.” In response, Timberlake infamously burst out laughing. In a 2006 profile with journalist <strong>Robert Haskell</strong>, Timberlake claimed that if&nbsp;“I was writing an article about [Britney], I would not be able to <a href=#>fight the urge to write every dirty thing about her</a>.” (Screenshots of the article <a href=# rel=noopener>were shared via X</a> by a Spears fan account on Thursday, October 19.)</p><p>Timberlake later apologized for the remarks,<a href=#> saying he wanted to “take accountability”</a> for his hurtful words in a lengthy May 2021 Instagram statement. “I know I failed,” he said at the time. “I also feel compelled to respond, in part, because everyone involved deserves better and most importantly, because this is a larger conversation that I wholeheartedly want to be a part of and grow from.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Meanwhile, as the release date for The Woman in Me looms closer, a second insider told Us earlier this month that Timberlake is trying to steer clear of the drama.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“Justin will always be supportive of Britney and all of her endeavors, <a href=#>but he’s trying to distance himself from her upcoming book</a>,” the source explained. “It’s not something he’s focusing too much on in terms of anything she might discuss when it comes to their former relationship.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Spears, meanwhile, took to Instagram on Friday, October 20, to clarify that her memoir isn’t meant to “offend anyone.” “That was me then … that is in the past!!!” she wrote.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Following his split from Spears, Timberlake&nbsp;went on to wed <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a> in 2012. The couple share sons Silas, 8, and Phineas, 3. Spears, for her part, shares sons Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federine</strong></a>. She recently separated from<a href=#><strong> Sam Asghari</strong></a>, who filed for divorce in August after 14 months of marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq9506Kkm52ioa6ssYyopZydXaiuqrCMoZxmr5%2BjwW6%2F06inZquZo7SqusZmmquxXaKybq2Mq6CvnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./full-coverage-of-wwe-13-roster-reveal-cm-punk-sandow-more.html><span>←</span><span>Full Coverage of WWE 13 Roster Reveal; CM Punk, Sandow &amp;amp; More</span></a>
