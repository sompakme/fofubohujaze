Correct spelling for the English word “I’m” is [ˈa͡ɪm], [ˈa‍ɪm], [ˈaɪ_m] (IPA phonetic alphabet). How do you use the word im? I’m is the contraction of “I am”, whereas am is simply the verb with no pronoun before it. No, it’s not grammatically correct to drop the “I” and start these phrases with “am”. Proper English requires the pronoun before the verb. Using the contraction (I’m) is the less formal (but still correct) way to say it.</description></item><item><title>Jennifer Lopez Reveals Her No. 1 Beauty Secret: Details</title><link>/jennifer-lopez-reveals-her-no-1-beauty-secret-details.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/jennifer-lopez-reveals-her-no-1-beauty-secret-details.html</guid><description>Catching some Z’s is the key to a youthful glow, according to Jennifer Lopez.
