The official Celebrity Boxing Instagram page commented as well, asking the 18159 Stout artist if he would be willing to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>get in the ring</a> for their promotion. Check out his boxing video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bizarre shared a photo of himself in the studio a few days before that, noticeably looking slimmer. “My office hour from 9 to 5,” he wrote in the caption. Fans were just as positive commenting on this post as they were under the boxing video. “Looking good bro those [pounds] dropping,” one person wrote. “Wow. @bizarresworld You’re looking good,” another fan commented. “You’re now as fit as an athlete.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Sucka Free” rapper’s health strides are especially great to see after he suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which has similar symptoms to a stroke, in 2021. Fortunately, he was able to make a quick recovery and was back in the studio working less than a week later.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He spoke about his difficulties with health back in 2019 with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>HipHopDX</a>, recalling having asthma as a child. “I was always a little guy who had asthma all the way up until I was like maybe 14,” he told HipHopDX’s Kyle Eustice. “Then I had a doctor put me on steroids for the asthma. That kind of made me gain weight. But through my adult years, I’ve basically been through the same thing that you’ve been talking about up or down, you know what I’m saying? Doing good, lost 20 pounds. Then you relapse or give yourself a cheat day and your cheat day turns into three days and then two weeks. It’s like an ongoing battle.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5l%2Bc3nBorGaqqKaeqO716KloGWmnrGmu9JmnZqmo2KusbzLmqydZaeatqi002ajqKujYn5zf5NxaGpqYmt8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bear-grylls-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Bear Grylls Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
