She lives in a state where it is very accessible to go into law, she comes from a family of lawyers, and she has become a vocal proponent of legal activism, especially for criminal justice reform. Kim Kardashian, prior to her entry into the legal profession, even lobbied for the release of wrongfully convicted prisoners and sex trafficking victims. But the question does beg for an answer, what kind of lawyer will Kim Kardashian be?</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-not-going-to-law-school><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Not Going To Law School</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One important thing to note about her new career path is that Kim Kardashian is not going to law school. “But how can you become a lawyer without law school?” One might ask. Well, in California having a degree in law is not a prerequisite for taking the bar exam, one can study the law under the apprenticeship of a judge or attorney or go to law school. But if one follows California’s apprenticeship program, one does have to pass something called <a href=#>the “Baby” Bar Exam</a>.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-passed-the-baby-bar-exam-after-several-tries><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Passed The Baby Bar Exam After Several Tries</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Baby Bar Exam, in accordance with California Law, <a href=#>is considered the equivalent of one year of law school</a>. Passing this test is a prerequisite for becoming a fully qualified attorney in the state of California. Once one passes the baby bar and endures another year or two of study as an apprentice, one can take the state’s bar exam. Kim has done that after 3 previous tries and has thus overcome a major hurdle on her path to becoming a lawyer. While social media trolls lampooned her for <a href=#>failing the first few times</a>, many lawyers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">do not pass their exams</a> on the first try.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Kim Kardashian Had To Say Following Kanye's Threats Towards Pete Davidson</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-studying-under-erin-haney-and-jessica-jackson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Studying Under Erin Haney And Jessica Jackson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian utilized her family's legal connections (remember, her father defended O.J. Simpson) to land an apprenticeship with two well-established woman attorneys, Erin Haney and Jessica Jackson. It is particularly interesting that Kim Kardashian would choose to study under Jackson because Jackson <a href=#>is a well-known civil rights attorney</a> who represents <a href=#>death row inmates in their appeals</a>. Convicts on death row usually come from incredibly poor backgrounds and cannot afford the type of legal counsel that some richer convicts have. Classism and the death penalty have been very prominent issues for the criminal justice system ever since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s. Studying under Jackson could indicate that Kim Kardashian will be focusing on civil rights and criminal defense.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-studied-contract-law-via-zoom><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Studied Contract Law Via Zoom</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Haney and Jackson are not the only ones helping Kim Kardashian study. Law professor Steve Calandrillo from the University of Washington helped tutor Kim in contracts and contract law via Zoom before she took the baby bar exam. When she passed the baby bar exam, Caladrillo was quoted by U.S. News saying “I am so happy for her… She has worked so hard for two years now. It is not an easy exam.”</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-might-follow-in-her-father-39-s-footsteps><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Might Follow In Her Father's Footsteps</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian going into law, especially criminal defense, makes perfect sense if one stops dwelling on the fact she is a reality TV star and remembers that her father is the late Robert Kardashian. Robert Kardashian was one of the most prominent Hollywood criminal defense attorneys, and he became world-famous in 1994 when he was a part of the legal team defending O.J. Simpson. Unlike her father, however, Kim Kardashian seems less concerned about high-profile celebrity criminal defense and more interested in overall criminal justice reform. This is especially obvious when one thinks about what she did for Cyntoia Brown.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kanye West Clowns Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson In A Photoshopped 'Captain America' Poster</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-already-been-instrumental-in-a-high-profile-criminal-case><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Has Already Been Instrumental In A High Profile Criminal Case</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyntoia Brown was convicted of murder and served several years in prison before finally having her sentence commuted. Brown <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was a victim of human trafficking</a> and she killed her trafficker in self-defense but was tried and convicted of murder. An outpouring of support for Brown began on social media when Kim Kardashian and other advocates for criminal justice reform spoke out and demanded Brown's immediate and unconditional release. Kim Kardashian, a prominent democrat, even made an effort to lobby GOP President Donald Trump when he was still in office for her release. Brown has been free since 2019. While Kim Kardashian was not the only one calling for her release, it’s safe to say the attention she brought to the case was a huge help. If Kim Kardashian is indeed going to be the civil rights defender she is poised to become, she is off to a great start.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kanye West Asks Fans To Scream At Pete Davidson If They See Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmLEqa3TZqKippRivKd5y5qusp2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-scott-says-he-never-cheated-on-kylie-jenner-but-a-fan-claims-to-have-receipts.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Scott Says He Never Cheated On Kylie Jenner, But A Fan Claims To Have Receipts</span></a>
