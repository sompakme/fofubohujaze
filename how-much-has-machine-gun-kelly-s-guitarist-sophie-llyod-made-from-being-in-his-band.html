While the rumors of Sophie and MGK's hookup have been shot down by Megan Fox herself at this point, the publicity has made the couple's base incredibly intrigued by her.</p><p>Sophie has been <a href=#>playing guitar in MGK's band since June 2022</a>, but the 27-year-old British guitar player had been working as an accomplished musician for years prior. Below we explain how her involvement in MGK's band came to fruition and just how much Sophie makes from being a part of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-does-sophie-lloyd-make-from-playing-in-machine-gun-kelly-39-s-band>How Much Money Does Sophie Lloyd Make From Playing In Machine Gun Kelly's Band?</h2><p>We don't know precisely how much Sophie makes from playing in Machine Gun Kelly's band, as the numbers aren't public. According to online reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Mainstream Sellout Tour made $33,680,513</a>. Sophie is entitled to a small percentage of that number, so taking into consideration just how well the tour did with sales, chances are she made over the six-figure mark for her time on tour with the singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-llyod-at-the-premiere-of-cirque-du-soleil-kurious.jpg><p>According to the guitarist's website, <a href=#>Sophie began playing guitar when she was only ten years old</a>, saying that she used it as a way to escape reality. "Because I was a bit of an outcast, I had a lot of time to practice, and this gave me an escape from reality, helped me overcome my anxieties, and really gave me a sense of fulfillment," reads a statement by Sophie on her website. After becoming infatuated with playing, she began practicing on her Yamaha Pacific after school for at least five hours a night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Meaning-Behind-Machine-Gun-Kellys-Most-Popular-Songs.jpg><p>In 2011 she began posting her metal and rock guitar covers on YouTube. She's amassed over 800,000 followers on the channel, and her videos get millions of views. MGK actually found Sophie through her YouTube channel. She joined the singer's Mainstream Sellout tour after he contacted her via social media. "MGK literally just messaged me on Instagram one day, after seeing some of my videos. We Facetimed, we seemed to vibe really well, and before I knew it, I had my visa and was flying from London to LA for rehearsals," said Sophie during an interview with NME.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-sophie-lloyd-39-s-net-worth>What Is Sophie Lloyd's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to online sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Lloyd has a net worth of $5 million.</a> Along with her compensation for being a member of MGK's band, Sophie makes a lot of money from her YouTube Channel and the brand endorsements she's gotten from her notoriety on the social media platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sophie-llyod-playing-guitar-with-machine-gun-kelly-s-band.jpg><p>Sophie is an incredibly talented musician and businesswoman, and before these insane rumors, that's what she was known for. Now her name is conflated with MGK and Megan's drama-filled relationship, something entirely outside the realm of her work. When her team commented on the nonsense news, they were sure to explain just how disrespectful the accusations were.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sophie Lloyd is a professional, accomplished musician who has been needlessly dragged into the media based off of meritless accusations made by social media. Any suggestion that she has ever acted in an unprofessional manner or stepped out of her relationship is untrue. It's disrespectful to her as a female artist and poor journalism and social commentary to be reporting anything else," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Sophie's PR team to Page Six</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/elSvDqLVQj3rLBXuE-N3NZn57yiVTMU-EJqafnXuDvA.jpeg><p>Before her team released a statement, Sophie quickly reminded the public about who she is in a relationship with, her boyfriend of five years, Christopher "The Painter" Painter. Rather than hiding from the trolls on social media, she shared a sweet snap of the two on Valentine's Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of Machine Gun Kelly's Most Daring Wardrobe Choices, According To Fans</a></span></p><p>Sophie and her boyfriend Christopher have also spoken kindly of MGK before this situation. "Don't bother with any of the bulls–t you read about MGK online. From what I experienced, they are the most amazing group of people you could meet," reads Christopher's Instagram caption underneath a photo of him and MGK.</p><p>"The MGK camp have been so incredible to Sophie and have also made me feel so welcomed, and will always be grateful for that," read the rest of his caption.</p><h2 id=did-sophie-lloyd-really-hookup-with-machine-gun-kelly>Did Sophie Lloyd Really Hookup With Machine Gun Kelly?</h2><p>According to Sophie Lloyd and Megan Fox, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the infamous hookup between the guitarist and MGK never happened</a>.

When a fan commented on her Instagram, "He probably got with Sophie," Megan didn't outright say no, but responded with a taunting, "Maybe I got with Sophie." Somehow, her response made fans think Sophie absolutely played a part in the pair's potential demise.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie's camp immediately put out a statement</a> to cool off the harassment Sophie was receiving, Megan decided to deactivate her Instagram account altogether. It would be days before Megan responded to the rumor's validity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Roleplaying Influenced Machine Gun Kelly To Become One Of The Biggest Artists Of His Generation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"How me making a joke in order to absolve this girl of a hurtful accusation somehow turned into a confirmation of it—I will never understand," said Megan. She directly addressed Sophie in her Instagram post, saying, "Sophie, you are insanely talented. Welcome to Hollywood. Your first unwarranted PR disaster. You have now been baptized by the flames of fame. It only gets worse from here, unfortunately. Just ignore it as much as you can." Sophie responded in the post's comments, "The internet is so wild! Sending so much love."</p><p>Time will tell if MGK and Megan are actually on the outs, sources close to the pair have said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple is attempting to work out their differences</a>. Here's hoping Sophie's name gets left out of the conversation from now on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmpuYnrumecaupWajlaG5unnGrqCtmaJiva2t2J6pZqufpbWqsYylo7KnlGK7psCMsKarrJhir6K6w2aqmqSRp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-noticed-an-icy-rift-between-travis-kelce-s-brother-jason-and-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-abo.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Noticed An Icy Rift Between Travis Kelce's Brother Jason And Taylor Swift, Here's The Truth Abo</span></a>
