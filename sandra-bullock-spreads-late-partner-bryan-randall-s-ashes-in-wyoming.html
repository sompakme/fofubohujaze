The clip included the gentle noise of water flowing down the river.</p><p>Bullock’s former costar <strong>Octavia Spencer</strong> showed her support for Bullock in the post’s comments by sharing several raised hands and heart eyes emojis.</p><p>Randall <a href=#>died at age 57</a> in August 2023. “It is with great sadness that we share that on August 5, Bryan Randall <a href=#>passed away peacefully</a> after a three-year battle with ALS,” the photographer’s family shared in a statement at the time. “Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request.”</p><p>They went on to note that they were “immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours,” adding, “At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan.”</p><p>In the wake of Randall’s death, Bullock-Prado <a href=#>praised her sister</a> for standing by his side through his illness. “I’m convinced that Bry has found the best fishing spot in heaven and is already casting his lure into rushing rivers teeming with salmon,” she captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo of Randall smiling. “ALS is a cruel disease but there is some comfort in knowing he had the best of caretakers in my amazing sister and the band of nurses she assembled who helped her look after him in their home. Rest in peace, Bryan.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a> revealed in August 2015 that Bullock and Randall had begun dating. “Bryan is such a sweet soul, and things couldn’t be more different from the toxic relationships she’s been in before,” a friend of Bullock’s exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in June 2019. Bullock also previously referred to Randall as the “love of my life” during a November 2021 episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>Red Table Talk</a>.</p><p>Over the years, Randall became a father figure to <a href=#>Bullock’s kids</a>, Louis, 13, and Laila, 11, whom she adopted in 2010 and 2015, respectively. (Randall also shared daughter Skylar, 20, with his late ex Janine Staten, who died in 2007.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have a partner who’s very Christian and there are two different ways of looking at things,” Bullock explained of her and Randall’s parenting styles on <a href=#>Red Table Talk</a>. “I don’t always agree with him, and he doesn’t always agree with me. But he is an example even when I don’t agree with him. … We’re saying it differently, but we mean the exact same thing.”</p><p>She went on to call their family dynamic “the best thing ever,” stating, “I don’t need a paper to be a devoted partner, a devoted mother. I don’t need to be told to be ever-present. I don’t need to be told to weather the storm with a good man.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZ6Zv6J5wa6jpaeToHq0vNGemJ2rXaGutbGMqZirrJ6av26u0bKYp2WilrulrculqmaZo52ytHnIp2SwsZ%2Bitq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noah-cyrus-relationship-with-miley-cyrus-and-everything-you-should-know-about-them.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Cyrus Relationship With Miley Cyrus and Everything You Should Know About Them</span></a>
