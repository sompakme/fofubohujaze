However, there’s one person who doesn’t appear impressed – her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to The Sun</a>, psychologist Jo Hemmings analyzed the differences between Taylor’s relationships with Travis and Kelce. She points out that while Travis is more than happy to showcase their romance, Joe was always more private, which could signal that he as well as loved ones in Taylor’s life are concerned about the fat-pace of her new romance with Travis.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</span><h2 id=taylor-is-acting-differently-in-her-relationship-with-travis>Taylor Is Acting Differently In Her Relationship With Travis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-08t095534-787.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Joe seemed to rush Taylor in and out of events,” Hemmings explained. “It was almost as if he was embarrassed to be with her.”</p><p>While this may be a red flag, it could also be a turn on for Taylor, as having a boyfriend who’s more secure with a public presence may be easier given her notoriety. "Travis is only too happy to showcase Taylor,” the expert continued. "Now she has her first real taste of freedom in a long time and with a boyfriend who is much more secure in himself.”</p><p>Hemmings also had an explanation for why things seem to be moving so fast in Travis and Taylor’s relationship – she’s “making up for lost time,” the expert explained, referencing rumors that Joe was unwilling to settle down with Taylor after six years together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she written in total?</span><p>"This is genuine and she is showing mature authenticity,” Hemming said, emphasizing her belief that Travis is a positive force in Taylor’s life. "At the end of the day, Taylor and Travis have nothing to hide. This is all healthy and good for her.”</p><p>Though Taylor may seem head-over-heels in her new relationship, there’s been various concerns over it, including from Travis’ family, who are apparently <a href=#>worried about the newfound attention Travis is receiving</a> and whether it could pose a security risk.</p><h2 id=travis-rsquo-loved-ones-are-worried-about-their-relationship>Travis’ Loved Ones Are Worried About Their Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce-1.jpg><p>"It's certainly been weird, the level that it is now," Jason, also a football star, told NBC Sports. "On one hand, I'm happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he's excited about, that he is genuine about.
