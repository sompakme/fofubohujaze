With that being said, which of the Canadian funnymen have the most green in their pockets? The most cash stuffed under their mattress? The most… you get the idea. Let’s take a peek at the contents of the piggy banks of the cast, shall we?</p><h2 id=the-original-series-had-a-7-year-run><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Original Series Had A 7-Year-Run</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kids in the Hall’s brand of wacky sketch comedy debuted in 1989. Featuring Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, Kevin McDonald, and Scott Thompson, the series was unique for its time, particularly in North America, incorporating drag (such as McCulloch’s Chicken Lady) as well as homosexuality (Buddy Cole, anyone?) within the sketches. The show also featured a few upcoming stars, most notably future Scream and Party of Five star Neve Campbell. The series lasted for an impressive 5 seasons before ending its original run in 1995. The show was also notable for utilizing the Canadian band Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet’s "Having an Average Weekend" as the theme song for the show.</p><h2 id=kids-in-the-hall-are-back-with-a-brand-new-season><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kids In The Hall Are Back With A Brand New Season</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When fans of the show first heard the news<a href=#> that the Kids in the Hall were coming back</a>, the news was met with much fan adulation. Season 6 of the hit show made its way to streaming giant Amazon Prime Video in May 2022. The revived season differed from the original show, lacking a studio audience. The show was praised by critics and fans, scoring a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
