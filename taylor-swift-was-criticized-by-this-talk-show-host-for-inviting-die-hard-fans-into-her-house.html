Not only does Swift have many fans, but her followers also care deeply about her, to say the very least. After all, Swift's most passionate fans care about everything from <a href=#>how she keeps getting rich</a> to <a href=#>how the pop star got her teeth fixed</a>.</p><p>Since Swift's fan following makes her one of the biggest <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> stars in the world, <a href=#>the best talk show hosts</a> love to talk to her. However, one talk show host called Swift out because they thought the pop star made a huge mistake with her fans.</p><h2 id=graham-norton-called-out-taylor-swift-for-how-she-treated-her-fans>Graham Norton Called Out Taylor Swift For How She Treated Her Fans</h2><p>One of the reasons that Taylor Swift is among the biggest pop stars of all time is her impressive staying power. Even though many of her peers seem to disappear in months, if not weeks, Swift has been popular for more than a decade, and she isn't going anywhere. Due to Swift's longevity, one of the best talk show hosts of all time was able to call her out in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-refused-to-stream-her-eras-tour-film-after-she-felt-as-though-the-studio-s-vision-didn-t-align-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg><p>When the original version of her album "1989" was released, Swift went over the pond to appear on The Graham Norton Show. During the resulting conversation, Swift was questioned about something incredibly unique she did as she prepared to release her hit album.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What are Taylor Swift's biggest hit songs</a>, according to Billboard?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Song Title:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Chart Debut:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Weeks At Number 1:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>"Bad Blood:</p></td><td><p>11.15.14</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Willow"</p></td><td><p>12.26.20</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"</p></td><td><p>11.27.21</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Cardigan"</p></td><td><p>08.08.20</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>"Is It Over Now?

As she prepared to release "1989", she <a href=#>invited a select group of her biggest fans to secret listening parties</a> she held at her homes in Los Angeles, New York, Rhode Island, and Nashville. Swift also invited a select group of her fans to her London hotel room for another listening party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-was-offended-by-joe-jonas-pregnancy-rumors-during-an-access-hollywood-interview-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift Was Offended By The Joe Jonas Pregnancy Rumors During An Access Hollywood Interview">Taylor Swift Was Offended By The Joe Jonas Pregnancy Rumors During An Access Hollywood Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift told an interviewer how upset she was about pregnancy rumors involving her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas.</p><p>After news of the secret listening parties got out, there was a lot of interest in what those experiences were like for fans. Unsurprisingly, many of the Swifties who were chosen to attend the listening parties took to social media to discuss their experiences.</p><p>However, in October 2014, a writer for Cosmopolitan named Anna Silman interviewed a Swiftie named Meg Arriaga who attended a listening party. In Silman's resulting article, she was able to give readers a full picture of what it was like to attend a listening party.</p><p>During Silman's article, the topic of security guards being there for the listening party only came up once. While that is stunning enough, according to what Silman wrote about what Arriaga told her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the security team was very friendly to Swift's fans</a> at the listening party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-being-protected-by-a-security-guard.jpg><p>"And we start going up and up, and eventually we stop, and security gives us a briefing and they said, 'Make sure you treat it like your best friend's house and just have fun.'"</p><p>Throughout Swift's time in the public eye, she has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the victim of a staggering number of stalking incidents</a>. Given that, it seems shocking that Swift opened the doors of her many homes to so many fans in a short period.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense that when Graham Norton asked the pop star about her fan listening parties, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the host expressed his concern for Swift</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/have-taylor-swift-s-parents-secretly-profited-from-her-career_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Have Taylor Swift's Parents Secretly Profited From Her Career?">Have Taylor Swift's Parents Secretly Profited From Her Career?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's parents are very private which has left fans wondering if they profit from her career.</p><p>"I just think Taylor, you know, not to sound like worst-case scenario Andrea, but, it sounds like a terrible idea. The worst idea."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After making that comment, Norton asked Swift, "Was it alright?" If Swift wanted to express that things went great, she failed in the seconds immediately following Norton's question.</p><p>Instead of instantly saying she was happy fans came to her houses and enjoyed the experience, Swift seemed to hesitate. After saying the word, "So…" in a loaded way, Swift prepared to describe what the listening parties were like. However, because of the way Swift said, "So…", Norton's audience started laughing, and the host jokingly tried to express her inner monologue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/graham-norton-revealed-more-than-one-bad-guest-made-this-remark-to-him-after-appearing-on-his-show-graham-norton-show_youtube.jpg><p>"Never doing it again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Norton presuming Swift's decision to have fans come to her house was a mistake, one of the show's other guests chimed in as well. Monty Python legend John Cleese jokingly advised Swift that she could just say no to Norton's question, "Was it alright?" At that point, the host was done giving Swift a hard time, so Norton remarked about how the pop star seemed to enjoy the listening parties.</p><p>"No, you had fun. You liked it."</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-thought-the-fan-reactions-to-her-listening-parties-were-hilarious>Taylor Swift Thought The Fan Reactions To Her Listening Parties Were Hilarious</h2><p>After Taylor Swift was able to talk about her listening parties during her Graham Norton interview, it became clear she enjoyed her experiences. On top of that, Swift left Norton's audience laughing when she revealed how she chose the fans who attended by stalking them online. However, it was Swift who was left laughing hysterically when she heard one of her fan's reactions to a listening party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-noticed-an-icy-rift-between-travis-kelce-s-brother-jason-and-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship_-front-right-_deposit-left-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Noticed An Icy Rift Between Travis Kelce's Brother Jason And Taylor Swift, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship">Fans Noticed An Icy Rift Between Travis Kelce's Brother Jason And Taylor Swift, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Many Taylor Swift want to know about her relationship with Travis Kelce's Brother Jason and his wife Kylie.</p><p>When Norton began talking about Swift's listening parties again, he brought up what a fan wrote about their experience online. Mainly, Norton expressed his opinion that "It is borderline confusing whether they had a good time or not."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is the biggest Swiftie in the world</a> , according to The Sun? While this is a highly debatable question, The Sun named Bilal Ilyas Jhandir as Taylor Swift's biggest fan. The reason The Sun chose Jhandir is he holds the record for singing the most opening lyrics from Swift's songs in one minute.</p><p>Since it seems safe to assume that Swift's fans would be overjoyed to be at the listening parties, Norton explained what he meant. As Norton read part of what Swift's fans wrote about her experience, he pointed out a theme. According to what Swift's fans wrote, they were so excited by the experience that they died.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-on-the-graham-norton-show.jpg><p>When Norton read quotes about Swift's fans dying from extreme joy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pop star began laughing very hard</a>. In fact, Swift laughed so hard that she repeatedly used her hand to cover her mouth. Swift also interrupted Norton to explain why she found what her fans wrote to be so hilarious.</p><p>"I love them so much because they always talk about dying. They're like, 'Rest in peace me. R.I.P. me. I died. Dead.' These are amazing. Oh my God. Those were so funny, I think I'm going to die. I'm just going to die right here.
