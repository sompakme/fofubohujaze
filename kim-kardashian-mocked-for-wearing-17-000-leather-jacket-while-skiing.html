But it appears Kim wasn’t thinking about that when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she rocked an $17,000 leather jacket</a> during a skiing trip recently.</p><p>There’s no denying Kim looked posh in her all-black outfit, as paparazzi caught the reality star hitting the slopes.

Everything together likely cost over $20,000. This may not be a lot for the billionaire, whose net worth keeps rising thanks to her successful SKIMS business and other ventures, but some fans pointed out online that it may not take long to ruin the leather jacket and pants, considering she wore them in the snow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screen-shot-2023-11-17-at-1-03-23-pm.png> Kim Kardashian&nbsp;<p>As per the photos, Kim didn’t seem too concerned getting the outfit dirty or roughed up, as she embraced the snow while appearing to take ski lessons with the ret of her group. Kim was joined by her sisters Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian. Her mom Kris Jenner as well as her partner Corey Gamble were also in tow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some research suggests that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">average American spends $1,800 on clothes per year</a> , making it hard to imagine dropping over 10 times that amount on a single outfit, one you’re going to go skiing in.</p><p>However, it’s been estimated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim’s wardrobe is worth at least $1 million</a>, so she likely has many expensive things hanging in her closet, in addition to her black ski outfit.</p><p>Perhaps the most expensive thing Kim has worn would be Marilyn Monroe’s dress, valued at over $4.6 million, which she rocked at the 2022 MET Gala despite criticism from people who said the dress was inappropriate given it’s a piece of history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I thought it was a big mistake</a>,” he said. “[Marilyn] was a goddess,” Bob Mackie, the fashion designer and costumier who created the dress for Marilyn, criticized Kim’s decision to wear it to the MET. “A crazy goddess, but a goddess. She was just fabulous. Nobody photographs like that. And it was done for her. It was designed for her. Nobody else should be seen in that dress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpKGdYriivsOaqqGhkaN6rrvCpJydZaearrO1zaBkpZ2RqbWmvoyjmJyjlal6tLfIoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-clarkson-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Clarkson Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
