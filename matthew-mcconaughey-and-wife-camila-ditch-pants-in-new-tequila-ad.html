Where’s the fun?” The camera then pans out to reveal that the duo aren’t wearing pants on their venture as a cheeky reference to the drink’s name.</p><p>“Pantalones orgánico,” Alves adds before they both state, “Please, do not keep yours on.” The ad ends with more motorcycle footage — revealing that their vehicles were being actually pulled on a dolly — as well as a shot of the two walking pantsless through an agave field.</p><p>The brand’s official <a href=# rel=noopener>website</a> describes the liquor as “really good, really clean fun” and states that it’s made from “100% Premium Organic Tequila [and] 0% Organic Pretentiousness.”</p><p>Given that the word pantalones — which is Spanish for pants — can also mean “guts” in Spanish slang, the drink is “all about having the guts to make that next move, to have fun and not take things too seriously,” the brand’s description states. “We all put our pants on one leg at a time, and just like pants our Tequila is for everyone.” The beverage is available in three different flavors — Blanco, Reposado and Añejo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matthew-and-Camila-McConaughey-Ditch-Their-Pants-In-Hilarious-Tequila-Ad-2.jpg><p>McConaughey and Alves, who wed in 2012, aren’t afraid of showing off their silly sides. Last month, McConaughey recalled sharing his <a href=#>embarrassing first kiss story</a> while discussing the topic with his sons. (The couple <a href=#>share three kids</a> — Levi, 15, Vida, 13, and Livingston, 10.)</p><p>While chatting with <a href=#><strong>Jason Bateman</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sean Hayes</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Will Arnett</strong></a> on the <a href=# rel=noopener>“SmartLess” podcast</a>, McConaughey revealed that <a href=#>his braces got caught</a> on the lips of the first girl he kissed. “They bled all over. We bumped noses and I didn’t know whether to [go] left or right and I double duked and I flinched, and it was not good, man,” he joked. “And then I got my son laughing and I’m like, ‘Trust me, you don’t have to try and be perfect. Just take your time.’”</p><p>Alves, for her part, previously shared that she and McConaughey’s mother, <a href=#><strong>Mary Kathleen McCabe</strong></a>, learned to “always end with a good laugh and a joke” after not hitting it off at the beginning of the pair’s relationship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She did all these things when I first came in the picture, right? And <a href=#>she was really testing me</a>. I mean, really testing me,” Alves told Southern Living’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Biscuits & Jam” podcast</a> in August, noting that McCabe would call her by her son’s ex-girlfriends’ names, speak broken Spanish to her and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matthew-and-Camila-McConaughey-Ditch-Their-Pants-In-Hilarious-Tequila-Ad-3.jpg><p>The two made amends following an incident on a trip to Istanbul. “I’m putting her to bed and I realized, ‘Oh my god, she’s full of s—t,” Alves quipped. “All she wanted was for me to fight back. And then from that day on, that night on, we <a href=#>have the most amazing relationship</a>, and I have so much respect for her.”</p><p>McConaughey later <a href=#>confirmed his wife’s story</a>, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight Canada</a> that people “don’t get into the McConaughey family easily.” He added: “We test you. And even in our own family with my brothers, and mother is one of us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKaanKeelsKotMSyZJqmlGLEqrLEZpqapZmhrm6wyK2aoWWglru1v4yipWamlax6tbHQrqClmV2WsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liam-payne-has-a-surprising-phobia-that-fans-find-totally-unrelatable.html><span>←</span><span>Liam Payne Has A Surprising Phobia That Fans Find Totally Unrelatable</span></a>
