The first audience that Murphy had to showcase his talent to were his classmates when he was just 15 years old. As a result of the success he had with his improv shows at school, Murphy decided to give comedy a real shot. He decided to start showcasing his work to larger audiences at comedy clubs as a teenager and Murphy's talent was quickly noticed.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Murphy was becoming a regular on the New York comedy circuit. He was a rising star and quickly gained a lot of attention.</p><p>It was during this time that Murphy heard that a spot opened on Saturday Night Live. However, after he got in touch with writer, Neil Levy, Murphy learned the spot had already been filled. This did not deter Murphy.

But the cast had already been set and there was not enough money in the budget to hire Murphy full-time. As such, he became a featured performer instead.</p><p>The pay Murphy received when he first started in SNL in 1981 was $4,500 per episode, according to Celebrity Net Worth.
