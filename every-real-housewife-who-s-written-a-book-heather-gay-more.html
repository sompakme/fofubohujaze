Plenty of <a href=#>Real Housewives</a> have started their own beauty brands and clothing lines, but there’s no more common pastime in the franchise than writing a book.</p><p>More than 40 Housewives past and present have <a href=#>become authors over the years</a>, writing everything from self-help guides to children’s books and juicy memoirs. <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a>, the most prolific author from the <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> cast, began her writing career in 2010 with the publication of her first cookbook, Skinny Italian: Eat It and Enjoy It — Live La Bella Vita and Look Great, Too!</p><p>The recipe guide was a commercial success, but its 2011 sequel —&nbsp;Fabulicious!: Teresa’s Italian Family Cookbook — wasn’t such a hit with her castmates. <a href=#><strong>Caroline Manzo</strong></a> took issue with a line that described her cooking “as Italian as the Olive Garden,” while <a href=#><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a> felt slighted by Teresa’s claim that she copied her sister-in-law down to “the chairs on my front porch.”</p><p>The New Jersey cookbook drama was hardly the last time a Real Housewives tome caused tension among friends. In April 2022, <a href=#><strong>Erika Jayne</strong></a> made headlines when <a href=#>she shared an Instagram photo</a> of costar <a href=#><strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong></a>‘ memoir in the trash. “Garcelle, even though you unfollowed me I’m sure you’ll see this,” the Georgia native captioned the post.</p><p>Six months later, however, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> confessed that she was the person who threw Love Me as I Am in the garbage. The <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum explained that she was upset by <a href=#>an early edition of the book</a>, which discussed her daughter <a href=#><strong>Amelia Gray Hamlin</strong></a>‘s eating disorder. The Rinna Beauty founder subsequently threw the book in the trash and sent a photo to a group chat that included Erika, who then posted the now-infamous snap <a href=#>because of her own feud with Garcelle</a>.</p><p>“She got so much s–t about [not] recycling,” Lisa joked during the RHOBH season 12 reunion in October 2022. “That’s when I really felt bad.”</p><p>Some Housewives, meanwhile, take on bigger targets in their books. In her memoir, Bad Mormon, <a href=#><strong>Heather Gay</strong></a> detailed her time in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I really felt like it was important if I was going to break the legacy of generations before me,” the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</a> star <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> ahead of the book’s February 2023 release. “I wanted to make sure that I told it with my voice, with my experience from my perspective, so that my daughters would understand, the generations that come after me will understand and that I left no stone unturned. And it felt like the only way to do that was with a book.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a complete guide to every Real Housewife who’s written a book:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Baw6a%2B2GapnpmcYrWwwdKerqKelWLEqbvSZq6roaSpsq95wGaZqKebYrWmrdOhnKtll5bGbrnOq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bart-colantuono-dead-ax-men-pilot-killed-in-helicopter-crash.html><span>←</span><span>Bart Colantuono Dead: Ax Men Pilot Killed in Helicopter Crash</span></a>
