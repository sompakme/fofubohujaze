And like a fool I believed her from the start.
She, she said she’d never hurt me,
But then she turned around and broke my heart
Why am I standing here, Missing her and wishing she were here.
She only did me wrong;
I’m better off alone.
She, she devoured all my sweet love,
Took all I had and then she fed me dirt."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
