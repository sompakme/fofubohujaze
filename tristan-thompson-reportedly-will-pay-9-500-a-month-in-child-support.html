According to sources, Nichols has sole custody and an official visitation plan will be resolved soon.

Following his birth last year, Nichols filed a lawsuit against Thompson for child support, where she alleged that he tried to give her $75,000 in hush money so no one would find out about the baby.</p><p>A month later, in January, Thompson publicly apologized to Khloé Kardashian on his Instagram Stories after the paternity test revealed he was Theo’s father. “You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you,” Thompson wrote. “You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years. My actions have certainly not lined up with the way I view you.”</p><p>The scandal took place while Khloé and Thompson were expecting their second child together with a surrogate. Their son was born in July.
