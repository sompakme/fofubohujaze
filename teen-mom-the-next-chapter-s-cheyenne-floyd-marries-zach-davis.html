Shortly before walking down the aisle, the MTV personality gifted her groom a display of white roses. Davis, for his part, wrote his soon-to-be bride a sweet note. “Here’s to a lifetime together!

I know we would have loved to get married this year, but with COVID and stuff [we couldn’t],” Floyd <a href=#>exclusively told Us in January 2021</a>. “We both come from really big families that are really involved with us. We tried to figure out, like, some form or fashion of what we could do, and it just wasn’t going to work to our standards or what we wanted and having our families there. So, we’re just gonna wait until it’s safe to do so.”</p><p>She continued: “Zach and I have gone back and forth with dating since I was a senior in high school. So, I think it was just, like, meant to be. Finally, we just looked at each other and were, like, ‘OK, I guess we gotta make it work this time.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As <a href=#>the happy couple</a> began planning their wedding while staying on top of their daily parenting duties, they remained unsure if <a href=#>Baby No. 3 was in the cards</a>.</p><p>“I’m trying to convince Zach to give me one more, but he said, ‘No,’” Floyd told Us at the time. “[I have] baby fever, but he shut that down so quick. I need some help convincing him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zGaroZ1do7K5wIycn5qopJq%2FtHnCoZyynZ6jsm6yy6iwnWWdlr%2BztcSsZLOZk516pa3Voqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-kuchar-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Kuchar Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
