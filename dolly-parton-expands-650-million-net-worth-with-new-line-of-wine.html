Jennifer Lopez recently endorsed an alcohol brand, despite admitting to rarely drinking, and it wasn’t received well by fans, who noted the hypocrisy. But so far, Dolly’s new project hasn’t received the same criticism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-30-at-12-11-39-am.png><p>Parton's impressive net worth is a testament to her multifaceted career and savvy business ventures. Beyond her music career, Parton has diversified her portfolio with various investments. She owns the Dollywood theme park in Tennessee, which has become a major tourist attraction.</p><p>Additionally, her stake in Sandollar Productions has seen success with hit films like Father of the Bride and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Parton's foray into the restaurant business includes partnerships with franchises like Dolly Parton's Stampede Dinner Attraction and various Dollywood eateries. Moreover, her branding extends to Dolly Records and Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, a literacy program that distributes free books to children.</p><p>More recently, Dolly found success upon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launching her own clothing and accessory line for dogs</a> , which debuted last year under the apt name Doggy Parton.</p><p>Through strategic investments and entrepreneurial endeavors, Parton's net worth has flourished, cementing her status as not only a music icon but also a shrewd businesswoman. Now, with her burgeoning wine line, Parton’s net worth only stands to grow – so long as fans are okay with her not drinking her own products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnaecocZuvMCrq6imXZrFsa3NnapmbmVleq61y6WgqKZdo7K1edaoqa2gXaOyuHnLoqWeZaeeu6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angenette-levy-at-young-age-has-achieved-a-huge-success.html><span>←</span><span>Angenette Levy At Young Age Has Achieved A Huge Success</span></a>
