"Death Proof has got to be the worst movie I ever make. And for a left-handed movie, that wasn't so bad, all right? — so if that's the worst I ever get, I'm good. But I do think one of those out-of-touch, old, limp, flaccid-d*** movies costs you three good movies as far as your rating is concerned."</p><h2 id=jackie-brown---74-727-492>Jackie Brown - $74.727.492</h2><p>Jackie Brown was released in 1997 and made over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$74 million</a> all over the world.

"I was going to do a new one every 10 years — the first one starting when Uma was 30, the second when she's 40, and the last when she's 50. Now we're not going to do that because I need at least 15 years before I do this again. Uma and I can do something else together, but picking this thing up again, we need distance, and a decade ain't enough."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hateful-eight---155-760-117>The Hateful Eight - $155,760,117</h2><p>When The Hateful Eight was released.
