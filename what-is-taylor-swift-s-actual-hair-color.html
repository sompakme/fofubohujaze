Along with wanting to know about her romances, favorite hobbies and her workout and skincare plan, some are interested in the actual color of Swift's gorgeous (usually) golden locks, her multiple hairstyle changes over the years, and how her ever-evolving looks might relate to her growth as a person and artist.</p><p>Like other natural blondes, as Swift has gotten older, the natural shade of her hair has darkened. Mainly sticking with her natural blonde look, the singer has explored and tried out several different colors.</p><p>A natural blonde, and true performer, Swift enjoys exploring new looks for appearances on-stage, in music videos, and attending other events, including awards shows, etc.</p><p><strong>It has also been said that Swift's natural blonde hair has darkened over the years.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-hairstyles-have-evolved-over-her-career>Taylor Swift's Hairstyles Have Evolved Over Her Career</h2><p>Taylor Swift has changed her hair color dramatically for performances on-stage and music videos. She can surprise with style, nearly unrecognizable with a dark hair color. Other times she stuns with a much brighter look than her usual sunshine shade. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">At times, the star has made bold moves with her own hair color</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-billboard.jpg><p>As Swift transitioned to a pop star, her style began to change. Around 2010, she appeared with a darker shade of blonde, and her coils had straightened. The Cruel Summer singer could often be seen wearing bright red lipstick, now one of her signature looks. After her copper color, in 2017 she made a switch to platinum blonde, but it seems <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift thought the color was a miss</a>, according to ShowBizCheatSheet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We very much wanted to give Taylor a new look. And make her into a sort of rock n' roll chick," Anna Wintour, who reportedly suggested the hairstyle, told Today. Swift paired her bleached hair with incredibly dark lipstick for the 2016 Met Gala, and stayed platinum blonde for Coachella.</p><p>The Shake It Off singer told Elle how she felt about the color. "Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella."</p><p>Her blonde hair has been golden, copper, ash blonde, platinum and Swift has reportedly highlighted and layered her blonde hair to provide depth and texture to her luscious locks. She's also experimented with pastel colors, including pink and blue at different times amid her golden waves. Swift has gone back to her lengthy golden locks in recent years, and still impresses many with changes she makes for videos and performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan at every show...</span><p>Swift has shown off multiple hairstyles throughout her career.

"When people look back on that album (referring to her 1989 album) and that touring cycle, they'll think of that hairstyle." Asked about certain styles for the album, she responded, "Well, I cut my hair, so I've never had short hair before. That's a big theme in this album."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>Through the years, Swift has changed her hairstyle, hair color and overall appearance. The Bad Blood singer has often switched between varying shades of blonde, even if she includes highlights and/or sometimes uses different hues within her hair.
