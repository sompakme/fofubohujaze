Years ago, Leno had considered joining forces with Kimmel on ABC, creating a power lineup together. Kimmel had agreed to terms, while Leno suddenly decided to dip and go back to his NBC roots. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leno had apologized for the moment.</a></p><p>"It’s interesting because I heard Kimmel talk to you about that, and that I’d called him — and I did — and I didn’t realize I was supposed to do a follow-up call with them, so I certainly apologize for that," Leno tells CinemaBlend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Lives With A Rare Neurological Disorder Most Fans Didn't Even Know About</a></span></p><p>As for Jimmy Kimmel, well he was finally confronted by Leno about the situation in the recent years <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's party</a>. As expected, things were awkward, and Ben Affleck didn't help things either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There was some awkwardness there. Then Leno and his wife Mavis walk in, and they come up and we’re talking and it’s a little bit uncomfortable. Then all of a sudden you go, ‘Don’t you guys have like a feud or something?’ “We stood there in shock and then you left,” Kimmel revealed about Ben Affleck at his party.</p><p>Affleck would go on to reveal that he was just trying to have some fun, while Kimmel was not amused...</p><h2 id=fans-applauded-the-chemistry-between-jimmy-kimmel-and-stephen-colbert-during-their-late-show-interview>Fans Applauded The Chemistry Between Jimmy Kimmel And Stephen Colbert During Their Late Show Interview</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar52319243.jpg><p>The Late Show interview has millions of views on YouTube, as expected. Kimmel and Colbert clearly hit it off, and there were no hints of a rivalry. In fact, the two hosts even share the same agent together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The conversation between the two was a smooth one, and fans agreed that the chemistry between the hosts was very much alive, and they should consider more work together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Was Told By ABC To Tone Down His Comedy About A Certain Person, But The Host Threatened To Quit Instead And Got His Way</a></span></p><p>One fan writes about the interview, "Get me more of Kimmel and Colbert in the same show, and I'd watch the hell out of it."</p><p>Another fan had an interesting idea of bringing together all of the popular late night hosts in one room.</p><p>"Corden, Fallon, Kimmel, Trevor, Seth, Letterman, Leno, and Stephen ought to come together for one epic episode of crazy comedic antics."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, there is a demand for late night hosts working together - and that also proved to be successful when Jimmy Kimmel did so alongside Jimmy Fallon.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-also-took-on-an-entertaining-crossover-episode-with-jimmy-fallon>Jimmy Kimmel Also Took On An Entertaining Crossover Episode With Jimmy Fallon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-3.jpg><p>It turned out to be an epic April Fools' Day stunt, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon ended up swapping late shows</a>, while keeping the details very secretive behind the scenes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel And Donald Trump Actually Have An Interview Together, And It Was Friendlier Than Most Expected</a></span></p><p>Speaking alongside THR, Jimmy Fallon admitted he was skeptical and nervous about such a process early on, and how the audience would react.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fallon shared, "I’m not really a prank guy, so I didn’t know if we could pull this off. Like, two seconds before they announced me, I was nervous. I was like, “I hope they like me.”</p><p>"We double-taped our show Wednesday, and then I got on a plane and landed around 1 a.m. Seven hours later, Jimmy and [Kimmel’s wife and show co-head writer] Molly [McNearney] were waiting in the parking lot to greet me. We got into hair and makeup and started filming. After that, they flew immediately to New York."</p><p>The networks were also left in the dark, but entertained by the end product, which took a lot more planning and prepping behind the scenes.</p><p>Although they were both familiar with the roles, both admitted that the process was very different compared to what they were used to. Credit to both of them for pulling it off, as it was an idea that two had wanted to explore for the last seven years prior!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZ2gnbKvecKoo5udoql6orrDZqGipZ2ueqy1zKacpWWgp7y3scNmq6GdqWKus7HNrWSroaaWubR5w66poqaXYsGpscirZKuZopp6qrrTnqmvoZWsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sasha-grey-bio-wiki-age-videos-family-the-x-birthday-education-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sasha Grey Bio, Wiki, Age, Videos, Family, The X, Birthday, Education and Net Worth</span></a>
