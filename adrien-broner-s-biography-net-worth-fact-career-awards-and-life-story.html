Broner fought 4 more times in 2010 against Rafael Lora, Carlos Claudio, Guillermo Sanchez, and Ilido Julio, stopping all of them.</p><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Ponce_De_Leon>Broner vs. Ponce De Leon</span></h4><p>Broner took his first major step up in weight when he competed against former Super Bantamweight champion Daniel Ponce de León on March 5, 2011. In what was truly a very closely contested fight, Broner came away with a controversial unanimous decision victory. Broner got off to a slow start, having trouble penetrating De Leon’s high guard. Broner came on strong in the fourth, hurting De Leon with a body shot. Broner slowed down in the middle and later rounds, though landed the cleaner shots, while De Leon proved to be the busier fighter. CompuBox had Broner landing 126 of his 351 (36%) of his total punches, while De Leon landed 127 of his 592 (21%) punches. Harold Lederman scored the fight: 96-94, in Ponce De Leon’s favour.</p><p>Broner’s next fight was on HBO’s Boxing After Dark show from Guadalajara, Mexico, Broner took on Top 10 Super Featherweight contender Jason Litzau in a fight scheduled for ten rounds. Broner landed combos on the ropes late in the first, with a straight right, left hook and then a right uppercut hurting the Minnesotan badly. He crumpled, and the ref leaped in, seeing he was out. The official end came at 2:58 of the first round.</p><h4><span id=WBO_super_featherweight_champion>WBO super featherweight champion</span></h4><p>After having no luck in securing a fight with Ricky Burns, the former WBO super featherweight champion, to fight him on November 26, 2011, Broner fought contender Vicente Martin Rodriguez on the undercard of the Saul Alvarez vs. Kermit Cintron fight card on HBO as part of a double header. He defeated Rodriguez by knockout in the third round, to win the vacant WBO Super Featherweight World title.</p><p>Broner made a successful first defense of his WBO belt against Top 10 Super Featherweight contender and mandatory challenger Eloy Perez on a Feb. 25, 2012 HBO-televised card. With a knockout victory. Broner controlled the pace and action from start to finish, beating Perez to the punch and walking him down with ease. The fight ended when Broner landed a straight hand on Perez, followed by another right hand as Perez was going down.</p><p>Broner’s next scheduled fight was to be on July 21, 2012, at the U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati, against Super Featherweight contender Vicente Escobedo. However, at weigh-in for the fight on July 20, Broner was 133 1/2 pounds, well over the 130-pound limit for the Super Featherweight class, and was automatically stripped of his title. The fight went on as scheduled and Broner won by 5th round TKO when Escobedo’s corner threw in the towel.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lightweight></span><span id=Lightweight>Lightweight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span id=Broner_vs._DeMarco>Broner vs. DeMarco</span></h4><p>Broners next fight was scheduled for November 17, 2012, in Atlantic City at Boardwalk Hall, and was aired on HBO. The fight marked Broner’s debut in the Lightweight division. The opponent was the WBC Lightweight champion and <i>Ring</i> No. 1-ranked Lightweight, Antonio DeMarco. Broner started the fight off boxing DeMarco, working behind his jab and using his shoulder roll defense to frustrate DeMarco. In the early rounds, Broner was able to hit DeMarco with his quick counter left hook several times. By the 4th round, Broner and DeMarco decided to stand toe-to-toe in the center of the ring and trade punches. It was Broner who got the better of the inside fight though, with his speed and quick combination punching taking its toll on DeMarco. By the 6th round, DeMarco was cut and his face was swollen in several places while still standing toe-to-toe with Broner, with Broner barely missing his right uppercuts and working the body of DeMarco as well. Then, in the 8th round, Broner opened up another fast combination which hurt DeMarco and then a swinging left uppercut sent DeMarco to the canvas for the first time in his professional career. DeMarco’s corner stopped the fight right after the knockdown, giving Broner his second world title in as many weight classes.</p><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Gavin_Rees>Broner vs. Gavin Rees</span></h4><p>CompuBox had Broner landing 241 of his 451 total punches. After the fight, Broner said he’d be interested in fighting Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Márquez and current WBO Lightweight champion Ricky Burns. Broner was set to make his first title defense on February 16, 2013, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Having no luck at getting fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns to fight him in February, Broner fought <i>Ring</i> No. 6-ranked Lightweight Gavin Rees instead.</p><p>Broner stopped Rees in five rounds, after Rees’ corner threw in the towel at the end of the round. Rees had some success early, when Broner was clowning and showboating, landing jabs and body shots. By round 3, Broner was in complete control, hitting Rees with his counter left hook at will, as well as hitting Rees at will on the inside. In the 4th round, Broner sent Rees to the canvas with a quick right uppercut, and landed more combinations as the round ended. In the 5th, after a brief clinch between the two, they separated and Broner landed a hard left body shot on Rees, dropping Rees to a knee. Broner ended the round teeing off on Rees, with Rees’ trainer throwing in the towel from the corner. CompuBox had Broner landing 48% of his punches in the fight, as well as ending the fight landing 40 of 57 in the final round.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=welterweight></span><span id=Welterweight>Welterweight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Malignaggi>Broner vs. Malignaggi</span></h4><p>After failing to secure a fight with fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns, Broner decided to move up two weight classes to Welterweight in order to fight two division champion Paulie Malignaggi. Malignaggi was the WBA Welterweight Champion and ”Ring” No. 6 ranked Welterweight. Broner defeated Malignaggi in a split decision, with one judge scoring the fight 115-113 for Malignaggi, and the other two scoring 117-111 and 115-113 for Broner, making him a 3 weight world champion at just 23 years of age. Malignaggi started the fight fast and aggressive, throwing many punches and applying his jab often. Broner found his timing by the middle of the fight, effectively timing Malignaggi with lead right hands and counter left hooks. CompuBox had Broner landing 246 (47%) of his total punches, and 214 (51%) of his power punches. Malignaggi landed 120 jabs throughout the fight, but only 94 (25%) power punches. Though there was some contention at ringside after the fight as to who deserved the split decision, The Associated Press agreed with the two judges who scored the fight for Broner, mirroring the score of 117-111 by one judge.</p><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Maidana>Broner vs. Maidana</span></h4><p>Broner made his first defense at Welterweight against former Light Welterweight champion Marcos Maidana. Broner had stated before the fight that he did not take training camp seriously for the Malignaggi fight, and that he was going to make a statement in his first defense. From the opening bell, Maidana swarmed Broner, punishing him to the body and the head. In the second round, a left hook sent Broner down for the first time in his career. Broner recovered and seemed to be on the verge of taking control over a tiring Maidana, but a Maidana right to the body followed by a left hook to the head once again put Broner down in round 8. Maidana punished a humbled Broner for the remainder of the fight, winning the fight via unanimous decision and giving Broner his first loss as a pro.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=light-welterweight></span><span id=Light_welterweight>Light welterweight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Taylor>Broner vs. Taylor</span></h4><p>Following a unanimous decision victory against Carlos Molina, Broner remained at junior welterweight to fight Emmanuel Taylor. Taylor won his last fight by way of unanimous decision against Karim Mayfield. Emmanuel Taylor started the fight charging Broner. Broner spent a large portion of the early rounds on the ropes, appearing to be unaffected by Taylor’s punches. In the middle rounds, Broner increased his punch activity, making for back and forth action. By round 8, Taylor’s activity reduced dramatically, allowing Broner to secure the last four rounds. Broner sealed the decision in his favor with a left hook to the jaw of Taylor which sent Taylor to the canvas in round 12. Broner won the fight via unanimous decision with the judges scorecards as 116-111, 116-111, 115-112. Broner landed 201 of 524 punches thrown (38%) while Taylor landed 181 of 655 punches thrown (28%).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=welterweight-2></span><span id=Welterweight_2>Welterweight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Porter>Broner vs. Porter</span></h4><p>On June 20, 2015 Adrian Broner lost a unanimous decision to the former IBF Welterweight champion Shawn Porter 118-108, 115-111 and 114-112 at a 144 lbs. catchweight fight. In the 11th round Broner was deducted a point for excessive holding. Porter who dominated the majority of the fight, was sent to the canvas by Broner in the 12th round. The knockdown was not enough to secure Broner the win, as the fight was one-sided for the majority of the rounds. Leading up the fight the Welterweight champ Porter also criticized, that Broner had a 157 lbs. limit clause in the contract, which stopped Porter from rehydrating to his normal weight on fight day. Porter was quoted as saying,“You want to move up into my weight, then move up! Don’t be scared. Don’t be worried. Don’t be afraid. Put your skill on the line along with your record. Put it all on the line at 147. Don’t put it at 144, then not want to talk about it.” The remarks came as Broner had repeatedly refused to comment on the catchweight situation, which many believed would put Broner in a negative light.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=return-to-light-welterweight></span><span id=Return_to_light_welterweight>Return to light welterweight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Allakhverdiev>Broner vs. Allakhverdiev</span></h4><p>On October 3, 2015 Broner won the WBA Light Welterweight title from Khabib Allakhverdiev by TKO in the 12th round. Broner’s win was not a surprise by boxing afficianados, as Allahkverdiev is known to be a slow, soft-punching opponent.</p><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Theophane>Broner vs. Theophane</span></h4><p>On April 1, 2016 Adrien Broner defeated Ashley Theophane by TKO in the 9th round. Before the stoppage by referee Luis Pabon, Broner was leading on the scorecards 78-74, 78-74 and 77-75. Theophane was rocked several times during the fight, almost leading to a knockdown in the 4th round. The fight was scheduled to be for the WBA Light Welterweight title, but Broner was stripped ahead of the fight, for missing the 140 lbs. limit. After the fight, Broner called out Floyd Mayweather Jr., as tensions between the former friends had increased in the past months, due to comments about TMT (The Money Team) by Broner.</p><h4><span id=Broner_vs._Granados>Broner vs. Granados</span></h4><p>Prior to Ricky Burns retaining his world title against Kiryl Relikh, talks emerged about putting Burns and Broner in a fight for December 2016. Broner announced he would next fight Adrian Granados on February 11, 2017 on Showtime Championship Boxing. Ongoing talks continued for a potential Broner vs. Burns fight to take place sometime in 2017. The fight card was pushed back a week to February 18.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=outside-boxing></span><span id=Outside_Boxing>Outside Boxing</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In October 2016, he posted alarming images and captions on his instagram page hinting suicide and on October 17, 2016, he was charged with a misdemeanor battery for allegedly choking out a waitress at Drai’s, a nightclub.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional-boxing-record></span><span id=Professional_boxing_record>Professional boxing record</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="wikitable collapsible uncollapsed" style=font-size:95%><tr><td style="background:#edf1f1;border-style:none none none none;text-align:center" colspan=2><b>Professional record summary</b></td><th style="background:#edf1f1;border-style:none none none none"></th></tr><tr><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:center><b>35&nbsp;fights</b></td><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:center><b>32 wins</b></td><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:center><b>2 losses</b></td></tr><tr><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:left><b>By knockout</b></td><td align=center style=background:#bfd;color:#000;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center class=table-yes2>24</td><td align=center style=background:#fdd;color:#000;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center class=table-no2>0</td></tr><tr><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:left><b>By decision</b></td><td align=center style=background:#bfd;color:#000;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center class=table-yes2>8</td><td align=center style=background:#fdd;color:#000;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center class=table-no2>2</td></tr><tr><td style=background:#f9f9f9;text-align:left><b>No contests</b></td><td style=background:#ddd;text-align:center colspan=2>1</td></tr></table><table class=wikitable style=text-align:center;font-size:95%><tr><th>No.</th><th>Result</th><th>Record</th><th>Opponent</th><th>Type</th><th>Round, time</th><th>Date</th><th>Location</th><th>Notes</th></tr><tr><td>36</td><td data-sort-value style=background:#ececec;color:#2c2c2c;vertical-align:middle;font-size:smaller;text-align:center class=table-na>N/A</td><td data-sort-value style=background:#ececec;color:#2c2c2c;vertical-align:middle;font-size:smaller;text-align:center class=table-na>N/A</td><td style=text-align:left><span class=flagicon></span> Adrían Granados</td><td data-sort-value style=background:#ececec;color:#2c2c2c;vertical-align:middle;font-size:smaller;text-align:center class=table-na>N/A</td><td data-sort-value style=background:#ececec;color:#2c2c2c;vertical-align:middle;font-size:smaller;text-align:center class=table-na>N/A</td><td>Feb 18, 2017</td><td style=text-align:left><span class=flagicon></span> Cintas Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td style=background:#bfd;color:#000;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center class=table-yes2>Win</td><td>32–2 (1)</td><td style=text-align:left><span class=flagicon></span> Ashley Theophane</td><td>TKO</td><td>9 (12), 1:10</td><td>Apr 1, 2016</td><td style=text-align:left><span class=flagicon></span> D.C.
