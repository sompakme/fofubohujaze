Why don’t I love it?’ Early on, I would never have encouraged it because I don’t think that young people need to be out there in the world, selling clothes and products to grown people. I just don’t.”</p><p>Turlington noted that beginning her own modeling career at age 14 helped give her “direction,” something she said Grace, 20, “doesn’t need” at this point in her life. “But I get that she wants it and I get that she’s also interested in being more independent,” Turlington added. “She’s a student first, which I’m happy about, like, I got that through when she told me [she wanted to model] like, I don’t know, maybe four years ago.”</p><p>Turlington shares Grace and her 18-year-old son, Finn, with her husband, <strong>Ed Burns</strong>. According to the supermodel, Grace “hated” having her photo taken as a child, but her opinions on the modeling industry changed as she entered her teen years.</p><p>“I was like, ‘OK, OK, OK. But [it has to be] when you are 18 and when you are already in college,’” Turlington said of her modeling guidelines for Grace. “And, a third one, it has to do with my agent, because I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust them, any of them. And there are plenty of great people in the industry and people that I can be friendly with and I can appreciate them, but I wouldn’t trust my daughter with them.”</p><p>With those rules in place, Turlington said Grace has been “dabbling” in modeling while also studying at her alma mater, New York University. “I think I’ve set her on a path, and I think she understands why I was a little bit reluctant,” Turlington stated. “It’s protection and it’s love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Christy-Turlington-Admits-She-Doesn-t-Love-Daughter-Grace-Modeling-She-s-a-Student-First-841.jpg><p>Grace has graced several magazine covers, walked on runways and appeared in a handful of campaigns since beginning her modeling journey. She credited her famous parents for helping shape her career and personal life in a November 2023 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>V Magazine</a>, stating, “I am who I am because of them, in every way: the way I look, the way I think, how I dress, my politics. I would never try and reject that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She made headlines in September 2023 after making her <a href=#>Milan Fashion Week debut</a> during the Alberta Ferretti spring/summer 2024 show.</p><p>“@albertaferretti thank you thank you thank you for having me in your show … in a castleeeeee!!!!!” she captioned a clip of her runway walk <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> at the time. “So so so honored to be a part of this beautiful collection 🫶🫶🫶.”</p><p>Outside of modeling, Grace also released a book of original poems and photographs, titled Derived From Us, in March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoKKewLXFjK2sq6SZo7S1u81mmJ2lmanAbr%2FHnmSdp5Wou7V5y6itnmWUlsKotNOeqWafopawpnnMqJuepJmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-christmas-story-cast-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>A Christmas Story Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
